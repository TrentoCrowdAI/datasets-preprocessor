173,Therapeutic effects of an indoor gardening programme for older people living in nursing homes,"Aims: To explore the activities of daily living and psychological well-being of older people living in nursing homes and also to examine the effectiveness of a gardening programme in enhancing socilaisation and life satisfaction, reducing loneliness and promoting activities of daily living for older people living in nursing homes. Background: Life in nursing homes can mean very limited physical and social activity, leading to further decline in function for many older people. Design: This was a quasi-experimental pre and posttest control group design. Methods: Older people from nursing homes were invited to join the eight week indoor gardening programme (experimental group), while older people in other nursing homes were treated as the control group; they received regular care without the eight week indoor gardening programme. There were 26 older people (25 female and one male; mean age 85 years) in the experimental group and 27 (20 female and seven male; mean age 82 years) in the control group. Demographic data including age, gender, educational level and financial situation were collected, in addition to information regarding life satisfaction, loneliness, physical activity and social network situation, before and after the eight week indoor gardening programme for both the experimental and control groups. Also, details of experimental group subjects' experience of the indoor gardening programme were elicited using open-ended questions. Results: There were significant improvements in life satisfaction and social network and a significant decrease in perception of loneliness for older people in the experimental group after the eight week indoor gardening programme, while the activities of daily living were unchanged for both groups after the programme. Relevance to clinical practice: Given the positive effects of gardening activities, it is suggested that they be promoted more widely among nursing home residents. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5471575785
299,Depression: A modifiable factor in fearful older fallers transitioning to frailty?,"Objective Fear of falling is one of the most common fears among community-dwelling older people and is as serious a health problem as falls themselves. Understanding fear of falling in fallers transitioning to frailty may help us identify effective strategies to reduce it in this already vulnerable group of older people. Our aim was to evaluate the psychological factors associated with fear of falling in a group of fallers transitioning to frailty when compared with robust or non-frail fallers. Methods Cross-sectional design where 301 fallers underwent assessment at the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic in Dublin () is seen. Fear of falling was measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, and frailty was measured using the Biological Syndrome Model. Psychological measures included assessment of anxiety, depression, loneliness, personality factors and cognition. Results Frailer fallers had increased fear of falling when compared with robust fallers (p < 0.001). Age, female gender and lower cognitive scores were associated with greater fear of falling in the robust group. For frailer fallers, higher depression score was the only factor associated with fear of falling on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio of having case level depressive disorder (CESD-8 ≥ 4) if you were a frailer faller was significantly higher than if you were robust (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006). Conclusion Fallers at a transitional level of frailty may represent a particularly vulnerable group psychologically who would benefit most from interventional stratagies with specific intervention components addressing depressive symptoms.

103,Factorial Structure and Measurement Invariance of the PANAS in Spanish Older Adults,"Developmental theories suggest age-related changes in the structure of affect. Paradoxically, the internal structure of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) has not been tested in Spanish older adults by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) despite it is the most widely used measure of emotional well-being in later life. The aim of this study was to examine competing models of the internal structure of the Spanish version of the PANAS, its measurement invariance, reliability, and external validity. Participants were a representative sample of 585 community-dwelling people aged 60 and over, who also completed depression, loneliness and life satisfaction measures. Results showed that the orthogonal two-factor model with correlated errors (RMSEA = .057, 90% CI [.051, .063], SRMR = .084, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97) was the best fitting solution. Measurement invariance analyses confirmed that the two-independent factor structure can be used across young-old and very old people, as well as in both males and females. It showed good reliability (PA: α = .93, NA: α = .83), criterion, convergent and discriminant validity (p < .01). Our discussion highlights the role of age and culture in the experience and expression of emotions.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.07679666812
235,"Experiential variables influencing play, foot-clasp mounting and adult sexual competence in male rhesus monkeys","(1) It is concluded that foot-clasp mounting, rather than social play, by juvenile rhesus monkeys is the appropriate index of the affectional development essential for normal adult heterosexual behavior in the male monkey. (2) The opportunity for continuous social interaction with peers, lasting at least three months, resulted in increased frequencies of display of foot-clasp mounts and decreased frequencies of social play by juvenile rhesus monkeys. (3) When the opportunity for continuous social experience was provided during the first year of life, the behavioral changes were manifested immediately and when this opportunity was delayed until late in the second year of life, changes in the frequency of play and mounting were correspondingly delayed. (4) Adult heterosexual competence was greatest in males that had the earliest opportunity for continuous social experience, intermediate in males with delayed social experience, and least in males with no opportunity for continuous social experience with peers. (5) Rearing conditions that produced the highest frequencies of foot-clasp mounting were associated with the highest adult heterosexual competence and rearing conditions that produced the highest frequencies of social play were associated with the lowest adult heterosexual competence. © 1979.",0,0,"not OA, not SI",1,,,,,0.6130129046
352,Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging,"This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates. It was also found that this effect is partially mediated by will to live. The sample consisted of 660 individuals aged 50 and older who participated in a community-based survey, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement (OLSAR). By matching the OLSAR to mortality data recently obtained from the National Death Index, the authors were able to conduct survival analyses. The findings suggest that the self-perceptions of stigmatized groups can influence longevity. Copyright 2002 by the American Psychological Association, Inc.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.653645713
358,A concept analysis of malnutrition in the elderly,"Purpose. Malnutrition is a frequent and serious problem in the elderly. Today there is no doubt that malnutrition contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Unfortunately, the concept of malnutrition in the elderly is poorly defined. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the meaning of malnutrition in the elderly and to develop the theoretical underpinnings, thereby facilitating communication regarding the phenomenon and enhancing research efforts. Scope, sources used. Critical review of literature is the approach used to systematically build and develop the theoretical propositions. Conventional search engines such as Medline, PsyINFO, and CINAHL were used. The bibliography of obtained articles was also reviewed and additional articles identified. Key wards used for searching included malnutrition, geriatric nutrition, nutritional status, nutrition assessment, elderly, ageing, and weight loss. Conclusions. The definition of malnutrition in the elderly is defined as following: faulty or inadequate nutritional status; undernourishment characterized by insufficient dietary intake, poor appetite, muscle wasting and weight loss. In the elderly, malnutrition is an ominous sign. Without intervention, it presents as a downward trajectory leading to poor health and decreased quality of life. Malnutrition in the elderly is a multidimensional concept encompassing physical and psychological elements. It is precipitated by loss, dependency, loneliness and chronic illness and potentially impacts morbidity, mortality and quality of life.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.7687108306
218,Desire for attention,"Seeking of attention appears to be intimately bound up with certain principles of motivation, especially the seeking of observable results of action and of optimum levels of stimulation, variety and challenge, and the relationship between results and the cost of achieving them—a high cost will tend to inhibit action but enhance the value subsequently placed upon what is achieved. These principles can be applied to personal relationships: thus friendship can be regarded as a situation involving facilitative feedback between persons, hostility as involving inhibitory feedback and loneliness as occurring when there is no feedback. Which of these situations occurs appears to depend upon the relationships between the costs and benefits of interaction between the persons concerned. The care of psychiatric or senile patients in the community appears likely to impose demands for attention which are unreasonably severe (“costly”). Any attempt to change community attitudes in the hope of securing greater acceptance of such demands appears to be unrealistic. Substantial benefits could probably be attained in many cases from training in skills, especially social skills, which would enable patients to cope more effectively with the world as it is. © 1977, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

256,Aging and hearing health: The life-course approach,"Sensory abilities decline with age. More than 5% of the world's population, approximately 360 million people, have disabling hearing loss. In adults, disabling hearing loss is defined by thresholds greater than 40 dBHL in the better hearing ear. Hearing disability is an important issue in geriatric medicine because it is associated with numerous health issues, including accelerated cognitive decline, depression, increased risk of dementia, poorer balance, falls, hospitalizations, and early mortality. There are also social implications, such as reduced communication function, social isolation, loss of autonomy, impaired driving ability, and financial decline. Furthermore, the onset of hearing loss is gradual and subtle, first affecting the detection of high-pitched sounds and with difficulty understanding speech in noisy but not in quiet environments. Consequently, delays in recognizing and seeking help for hearing difficulties are common. Age-related hearing loss has no known cure, and technologies (hearing AIDS, cochlear implants, and assistive devices) improve thresholds but do not restore hearing to normal. Therefore, health care for persons with hearing loss and people within their communication circles requires education and counseling (e.g., increasing knowledge, changing attitudes, and reducing stigma), behavior change (e.g., adapting communication strategies), and environmental modifications (e.g., reducing noise). In this article, we consider the causes, consequences, and magnitude of hearing loss from a life-course perspective. We examine the concept of ""hearing health,"" how to achieve it, and implications for policy and practice. © 2016 The Author 2016.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.8424659823
55,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.2147566638
197,The views of older community residents toward mental health problems,"A series of focus groups were conducted at two senior centers and two senior congregated housing developments in the greater Baltimore Metropolitan area in order to examine the views older adults have about mental health services. Among the several themes that emerged from the focus groups were: (a) depression and anxiety were seen as very common in older adults; (b) barriers such as the stigma, cost, fragmentation of services, transportation, and primary care physicians made it difficult to seek care; (c) seniors felt more resilient than younger adults; (d) seniors had a mixed reaction to others experiencing mental health problems; (e) individuals are responsible for their own mental health care; (f) mental health treatment works; and (g) mental health problems could be prevented. Among the recommendations made by the authors are to increase use of senior centers to reduce social isolation and promote health, education and well-being in a nontraditional setting. Also, primary care physicians must be encouraged and educated in the recognition, screening, assessment, treatment and referral for mental health problems in older adults. And lastly, physicians need to understand how the stigma of mental health problems can cause difficulty when older adults speak about mental health issues.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.1836286869
81,Intelligent integrated networks for aged people,"With the aging of the population and the increase of the health risks, the percentage of old singles grows tremendously. Loneliness and fear are common among elderly people seem to be related to each other and were both found to be ""threats"" to a good life in old age. ICT and technological innovations in other fields offer opportunities to bring independent living in old age. Smart home and consumer electronic developments can make management of the home and everyday living a lot easier for older people. But the automation of a domotic house shouldn't risk to take away the few social contacts an old user still has with human beings. The automation of a domotic house shouldn't risk to take away the few social contacts an old user still has with human beings. The intelligent houses for the old people should consider three class of functions: safety and security, environment comfort and sanitary surveillance. These activities are carried out with respect to the security, the safety and the privacy of the user. In this paper we propose an architecture that allows the maximum help to old people, but that respect their needs. It is organized in two logical networks: a Daily Support Network (DSN) and a Village Network (VN). The focus of this architecture is based on human aspects of the elderly people needs, to improve the quality of life of elderly people and their caregivers. The final goal is facilitating an independent and not isolated, good social life, inside one's home as long as possible.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.2974377968
341,Evaluation of community planning and life of senior cohousing projects in Northern European countries,"Cohousing schemes were evolved as alternative housing to reduce housework for working women, and to reduce loneliness of elderly people by promoting active mutual relationship with community residents in northern European countries. This article discusses how residents manage their life in senior cohousing projects in Sweden and Denmark. The purpose of this study is to investigate residents' life satisfaction connected with demographic characteristics of residents, physical environment and common activities in the senior cohousing communities, so that it could offer usable information for the establishment of new senior cohousing projects in other countries, as well as an empirical evaluation of the existing projects in Scandinavian countries themselves. Important variables influential to residents' life satisfaction are also discussed in order to improve senior citizens' quality of life. The methods used for the study are literature review, interviews, field trips and questionnaire. Nine hundred and thirty-five postal questionnares were sent to 28 senior cohousing communities throughout Denmark and Sweden. Of those 536 replies were collected and analysed by SPSS program using frequency, mean and Chi-square test. As a result, it was found out that most of the respondents are healthy, 70-year-olds, and satisfied with their current living in the community. The majority of them also would like to strongly recommend others to move to senior cohousing schemes to improve quality of life in their later years. Residents' intensive concern about building location and design is a noteworthy reminder for designers and architects as well as for professionals and decision-makers who work in the elderly welfare sector. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1671291807
298,Senior centers: Traditional and evolving roles,"The first senior center in the United States, the William Hodson Community Center in New York City, opened its doors in 1943. Its purpose was to reach out to people who had retired but needed a place to gather to stay connected to others. Senior centers serve as an entry point for the aging service network and protect against social isolation. One popular perception - that senior centers are welfare programs - has inhibited many elders from seeking services, and it needs to be dispelled. These centers do not just offer low-cost meals, nor provide institution-like services; they are diverse and vital institutions. Recent studies indicate that participation in senior centers has been declining, and center personnel are looking for new ways to reach the ""young- old"" who have yet to participate and the ""old-old"" who may face challenges getting to the center. Pharmacists are in the ideal position to offer health and wellness programming and caregiver education in this setting. Senior centers are also good places to train students, who are often surprised at the range of seniors' interests and cognitive abilities. © 2012 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

303,"Geriatric vision loss due to cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma","The major causes of impaired vision in the elderly population of the United States are cataracts, macular degeneration, and open-angle glaucoma. Cataracts and macular degeneration usually reduce central vision, especially reading and near activities, whereas chronic glaucoma characteristically attacks peripheral vision in a silent way, impacting balance, walking, and driving. Untreated, these visual problems lead to issues with regard to taking medications, keeping track of finances and personal information, walking, watching television, and attending the theater, and often create social isolation. Thus, visually impaired individuals enter nursing homes 3 years earlier, have twice the risk of falling, and have 4x the risk of hip fracture. Consequently, many elderly with low vision exercise greater demands on community services. With the prospect of little improvement and sustained visual loss, in the face of poor tolerance of low-vision services and not accepting magnification as the only way to read, clinical depression is common. In many instances, however, early and accurate diagnosis can result in timely treatment and can preserve quality of life. This review will look at current diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Currently, about 20.5 million people in the United States have cataracts. The number will reach 30 million by 2020. About 1.75 million Americans currently have some form of macular degeneration, and the number is estimated to increase to 2.95 million in 2020. Approximately 2.2 million Americans have glaucoma, and by 2020 that number is estimated to be close to 3.4 million people. It is projectedthat by 2030 there will be 72.1 million seniors. With some overlap of the above 3 groups conservatively estimated (if you add the 2030 cataract group to the macular degeneration and glaucoma groups), then about 1 in 2 senior individuals by 2030 may have some significant ocular disease, which could account for about 50% of the healthcare budget for the elderly. © 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2067674508
250,Morphine treatment during juvenile isolation increases social activity and opioid peptides release in the adult rat,"The consequences of juvenile isolation and morphine treatment on general activity, social activity and endogenous opioid release during a social interaction test were investigated in the adult rat. Rats were either isolated or socially housed during weeks 4 and 5 of age and treated daily during this isolation period subcutaneously with either saline or morphine. Directly after a social interaction test at 10 weeks of age, rats were injected with [3H]-diprenorphine and subsequently prepared for in vivo autoradiography. The autoradiographic technique was used to visualise neuroanatomical changes in opioid receptor occupancy, probably reflecting changes in opioid peptide release, as a result of social activity. Juvenile isolation increased general activity during the social interaction test, an effect which was accompanied by a reduction of opioid receptor occupancy in many brain areas, suggesting an increased opioid peptide release as a consequence of socially-induced general activity. Morphine treatment in isolated rats caused an increase in adult social activity and enhanced opioid peptide release in some cortical regions and the ventral tegmental area as compared to saline treated rats. Both social activity and opioid receptor occupancy were unaffected by morphine treatment in non-isolated rats. The present study underscores the role of opioid systems in adult social behaviors as a consequence of juvenile isolation. The results suggest a relationship between social activity and opioid peptide release during social contact. Increased social activity seems to be accompanied by elevated opioid peptide release in distinct brain areas after morphine treatment during juvenile isolation.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2472920772
273,Using assistive technologies to improve lives of older adults and people with disabilities,"In recent times, the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has significantly impacted our lives and daily activities. From 2000-2011, the use of the Internet has increased to 151.7% within North America. As infrastructures in all parts of the continent continue to improve and advance the technological capabilities of the Internet and the World Wide Web, more individuals are its communications potential. Unfortunately, many individuals do not realize that aging or a disability can change how they interact with these two technologies. In the technological society of the United States, there is a gap between young people and older individuals, especially when it comes to using the Internet and the World Wide Web. Older individuals are less inclined to use the Internet or the World Wide Web; and young people generally stereotype older individuals as lonely, conservative, and closed-minded to technology. However, younger individuals do not understand the effects of aging, especially when using mobile or computer technologies. One aspect of this research paper will explore, what types of educational tools exist to help younger people understands the effects of aging? For older individuals, the experience of loneliness can lead to mental health conditions including depression. In addition, older adults who do not stimulate their cognitive memories can lead to Alzheimer's Syndrome and other memory loss conditions. Surprisingly, there is an increase of older adults using the Internet for communications. However, there are still some challenges older adults face with technology. Older individuals may have a fixed income or rely on Social Security or Disability support; this creates problems as computers can be expensive to purchase. In addition, older adults may have difficulties with using the computer, as far as using the hardware or software components. Software obstacles include: small text size, complex menus options, and high level of stimulation from animated software components. This can also include the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. This research will study the interactions between older adults and their use of mainstream technologies. Although older individuals and people with disabilities have increased their use of the Internet they share common difficulties and complications. In addition, their disabilities often expand the aging complications that older adults experience. For people with disabilities, their main struggle is integration within today's society, especially using the computer technologies or Internet. This research will also explore what assistive technology software is available to older individuals and people with disabilities, the emerging field of open source assistive technology, and how assistive technology improves the quality of life of these individuals. © 2012 IEEE.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.332633623
379,Getting Grandma Online: Are Tablets the Answer for Increasing Digital Inclusion for Older Adults in the U.S.?,"Using information and communication technologies (ICTs) can improve older adults’ quality of life. ICT use is associated with decreased feelings of loneliness and depression, along with increased feelings of independence and personal growth. However, limited access and low technological self-efficacy are key reasons why some groups, especially older adults, are excluded from being fully engaged in the digital world. In this study, we focus on older adults’ technological self-efficacy, which is related to their actual use of technology and the second level digital divide. Specifically, we examine: (a) how older adults decide to use a new technology, tablet computers; (b) how they conquer the barrier of technological self-efficacy through using tablets; and (c) the impacts of using this new technology in their lives. Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with older adults residing in independent living communities in a medium-sized city in the Deep South region of the United States. Observational and enactive learning played important roles for older adults in using tablets. Seeing others use tablets, getting recommendations from family members, or having tablets given to them were the primary reasons they started to use tablet computers. The ease of use feature of tablets helped solve the problem of lacking technological self-efficacy. Using tablets helped increase a sense of connectedness. Tablet computers may be one way to increase digital inclusion among older adults. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.8725333355

Assistive technologies address important health needs, but there is a lack of social technologies that adequately deal with social isolation. This paper contributes to knowledge about the everyday life of older people for the purpose of designing appropriate social technology. We present an overview of the findings of a three-stage study-an expert survey, a field study and a design workshop-and describe a set of needs to inform the design of technology for ameliorating the social isolation of older people.

18,Empowering and integrating senior citizens with virtual coaching (Workshop summary),"With Europe's aging population and an increasing number of older people living alone or geographically distant from kin, loneliness is turning into a prevalent issue. This might involve deleterious consequences for both the older person and society, such as depression and increased use of healthcare services. Virtual coaches that act as friend in a para-social relationship but also as mentor that helps the elderly end-user to create meaningful relationships in his actual social environment are a powerful method to overcome loneliness and increase the quality of life in the elderly population. The AAL Joint Programme projects A2E2 (AAL-2008-1-071) and V2me (AAL-2009-2-107) are exploring virtual coaches and their application in AAL scenarios, including the use of user avatars, virtual self-representations that allow the user to be represented in communication scenarios. Other European research projects that focus on social integration of the elderly are e.g. ALICE (AAL-2009-2-091) or WeCare (AAL-2009-2-026). Outside the European Union the negative implications of population aging can be observed in Japan, having an even larger proportion of senior citizens, using individual-centred devices, such as robot pets [1], to improve the quality of life of lonely elderly persons. The user groups involved often are not acquainted with modern ICT systems and therefore it is a challenge to create intuitive, adaptive platforms that cater to the individual needs and allow the user to interact easily. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,1,no intervention,0,,,,,0.4663035708
186,Impact of senior center friendships on aging women who live alone,"Elderly women who live alone are considered at greater risk for loneliness, depression, and decreased mobility. This paper examines the influences of late-life friendships and senior center activities on the health and well-being of aging women living alone. Based on the findings from 274 women living alone it was found that the senior center is an excellent environment where new supportive friendships can easily be formed. These friendships and other center activities have positive mental and physical outcomes. Using a comparison group of 171 elderly women living with their spouses, it was discovered that women who lived alone participated in center activities more frequently and, as a result, also created a social network that extended outside of the center environment. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

320,Coping with ageing and failing health: A qualitative study among elderly living alone,"The purpose of this study was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how the elderly cope with being sick, unhealthy and living alone. Qualitative research interviews using a hermeneutic approach was undertaken to explore how the patients experienced coping with their daily life. Twenty patients with an average age of 82 years having different injuries and diseases were interviewed. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed in a hermeneutical tradition of the hermeneutic circle: part-whole, pre-understanding-understanding, and primary, secondary and basic themes. Findings showed that even if physical constraints put limits on their level of activity, the elderly were able to adapt and carry out different activities that did not require any physical strength. The main coping strategy was to accept the situation, but the acceptance was often coloured by a resigned and passive acceptance. If the elderly tend to be passive and resigned, it can be necessary for the community nurses to have a more active problem-solving approach to these patients, in order to help them creating a daily rhythm with which they can feel comfortable. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8956696427
150,Portraits of loneliness: Emerging themes among community-dwelling older adults,"With aging comes a multitude of possible losses, including loss of health, spouse, friends, or independence. These losses can place older adults at risk for isolation and loneliness. Loneliness is of significant concern in older adults, as it can negatively affect their quality of life. An interpretive phenomenological study was conducted to explore the meaning of loneliness in 12 older adults living in the community. Selected excerpts from the participants reveal several themes, as well as the importance of maintaining meaningful connections and relationships with others to alleviate feelings of loneliness.

319,Nursing interventions to assist in decreasing stress in caregivers of Alzheimer's patients.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most progressive, degenerative neurologic disease of the brain and the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults, affects people who are beyond the 65 year age range. Although AD may affect people who are younger, it is definitely a painful and stressful experience for the patient as well as for loved ones. There are many stressors involved in the care of a person affected by AD: loneliness, depression, coping with unpredictable patient behavior, lack of knowledge regarding care of AD patients, etc. Monitoring the safety of AD patients and taking care of basic needs are sometimes challenging for caregivers. Nursing interventions would include: encouraging caregivers to learn more about the disease, understand what is available in the community for social support and understand legal and financial issues.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6050064953
292,Living within your limits': Activity restriction in older people experiencing chronic pain,"Background: Although maintaining activity is key to successful pain management, and important to health and wellbeing, it is known that older people in pain frequently alter or reduce activity levels. A 'fear-avoidance' model is often used to explain avoidance of activity in the face of pain. However, this model is not intended to take account of the wider context in which activity changes take place, nor older people's own explanations for their behaviour. Objective: to investigate the reasons why older people in the community adjust their activity levels when living with chronic pain. Methods: thirty-one people aged between 67 and 92 were purposively sampled from respondents to a community-based cross-sectional survey. All participants had reported long-term pain and were interviewed about this. Data were collected and analysed using a qualitative constructivist grounded theory approach. Findings: explanations for deliberative reduction or ceasing of activities reflected a desire to prevent pain exacerbation, thereby avoiding medical intervention. It also reflected a desire to safeguard autonomy in the face of pain in older age. Restrictions were often rationalised as normal in older age, although co-existing accounts of perseverance and frustration with limitation were also evident. Conclusions: a rational desire to avoid pain exacerbation and medical intervention motivated restrictions to activity. However, deliberative limitation of activity has the potential to compromise autonomy by increasing social isolation and de-conditioning.

208,The suicidal patient in long-term care institutions.,"In comparison with older adults living in the community, elders who are institutionalized are older, sicker, and more likely to have no living family members, factors that place them at risk for suicide. Somatization, or physical suffering, is a frequently overlooked symptom of elderly depression, perhaps because it is falsely assumed that such symptoms expressed by the older adult are normal concomitants of aging. Strengthening and extending existing family roles in supporting the elder who is suicidal and depressed is vital to reducing loneliness, emotional pain, loss of independence, and to increasing self-concept. An expanded knowledge of mental health needs of older adults and their families is critical in suicide prevention. A major step toward prevention is the recognition of depressive symptomatology and key elements and clues to suicide in the institutionalized elderly.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5119192095
155,Dispositional optimism and loneliness in older men,"Background Dispositional optimism, defined as a generalized tendency to positive outcome expectancies, is associated with well-being and successful aging. However, it remains unclear whether optimism is also correlated to less feelings of loneliness over time. We aimed to determine whether dispositional optimism is prospectively associated with less feelings of loneliness, independently of potential confounders inherent to the aging process. Methods We observed 416 older men aged between 70 and 89 years (mean 74.9years, standard deviation [SD] 4.7 years) within the population-based Zutphen Elderly Study during 10 years of follow-up. Baseline dispositional optimism was assessed using a four-item questionnaire. The presence of feelings of loneliness, the main outcome of our study, was assessed using the 11-item loneliness scale of De Jong Gierveld in the years 1990, 1993, 1995, and 2000. The association between baseline dispositional optimism and loneliness over time was tested by using multilevel regression analysis and by adjusting for potential confounders (i.e. age, living arrangement, social contacts, widowhood, memberships, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms). Results Feelings of loneliness significantly increased during 10years of follow-up but showed temporal stability (reliability coefficient 0.78). Low baseline dispositional optimism was strongly associated with loneliness over time, also in the adjusted analysis. A 1 SD increase in baseline dispositional optimism was associated with a 0.14 SD (95% confidence interval 0.04-0.23) lower level of loneliness (F1,3207.8; p=0.006). Conclusions Dispositional optimism is correlated to lower feelings of loneliness over time in older men, independently of depression or changes in social network. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2891093795
107,Association of social isolation and health across different racial and ethnic groups of older Americans,"Social isolation is a social and public health problem that affects people of all ages, especially elders. Previous studies have found that social isolation across numerous industrialised countries is associated with negative health outcomes. However, it is unknown whether and how this association differs by race/ethnicity and age. To begin to address this gap, this study examines the association of social isolation and physical and mental health among Black, White and Hispanic elders in the United States of America. Building on Cornwell and Waite's perceived isolation and social disconnectedness dimension model of social isolation, the author used multi-stage survey data from a nationally representative sample of 3,005 community-residing adults aged 57-85 from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Tests for association were conducted on health by age, gender, marital status, education and race/ethnicity separately. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to test the association of social isolation and health exclusively and separately among these three groups. Results showed that social isolation is strongly associated with physical and mental health. Both perceived isolation and social disconnectedness had a significant negative association with physical and mental health among White elders. For Blacks, social disconnectedness is negatively associated with their physical health while perceived isolation had a negative association with mental health. Among Hispanic elders, there seemed to be no association between social isolation and physical health, but a significant negative association was found with their mental health. Despite various associated patterns, however, social isolation overall was associated with health outcomes that were similar across three elder groups. By identifying factors influencing social isolation and health among minority older Americans, this study has relevance to the development of culturally sensitive health-care practice and services, which may be applicable to minority elders in different countries. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7325267786
347,Eating habits and appetite control in the elderly: The anorexia of aging,"Although a high prevalence of overweight is present in elderly people, the main concern in the elderly is the reported decline in food intake and the loss of the motivation to eat. This suggests the presence of problems associated with the regulation of energy balance and the control of food intake. A reduced energy intake causing body weight loss may be caused by social or physiological factors, or a combination of both. Poverty, loneliness, and social isolation are the predominant social factors that contribute to decreased food intake in the elderly. Depression, often associated with loss or deterioration of social networks, is a common psychological problem in the elderly and a significant cause of loss of appetite. The reduction in food intake may be due to the reduced drive to eat (hunger) resulting from a lower need state, or it arises because of more rapidly acting or more potent inhibitory (satiety) signals. The early satiation appears to be predominantly due to a decrease in adaptive relaxation of the stomach fundus resulting in early antral filling, while increased levels and effectiveness of cholecystokinin play a role in the anorexia of aging. The central feeding drive (both the opioid and the neuropeptide Y effects) appears to decline with age. Physical factors such as poor dentition and ill-fitting dentures or age-associated changes in taste and smell may influence food choice and limit the type and quantity of food eaten in older people. Common medical conditions in the elderly such as gastrointestinal disease, malabsorption syndromes, acute and chronic infections, and hypermetabolism often cause anorexia, micronutrient deficiencies, and increased energy and protein requirements. Furthermore, the elderly are major users of prescription medications, a number of which can cause malabsorption of nutrients, gastrointestinal symptoms, and loss of appetite. There is now good evidence that, although age-related reduction in energy intake is largely a physiologic effect of healthy aging, it may predispose to the harmful anorectic effects of psychological, social, and physical problems that become increasingly frequent with aging. Poor nutritional status has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic diseases commonly affecting the elderly. Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, immune dysfunction, anemia, reduced cognitive function, poor wound healing, delayed recovery from surgery, and ultimately increased morbidity and mortality. An increasing understanding of the factors that contribute to poor nutrition in the elderly should enable the development of appropriate preventive and treatment strategies and improve the health of older people.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.08943681049
115,How much does it hurt to be lonely? Mental and physical differences between older men and women in the KORA-Age Study,"Objective Loneliness has a deep impact on quality of life in older people. Findings on sex-specific differences on the experience of loneliness remain sparse. This study compared the intensity of and factors associated with loneliness between men and women. Methods Analyses are based on the 2008/2009 data of the KORA-Age Study, comprising 4127 participants in the age range of 64-94 years. An age-stratified random subsample of 1079 subjects participated in a face-to-face interview. Loneliness was measured by using a short German version of the UCLA-Loneliness-Scale (12 items, Likert scaled, ranging from 0 to 36 points). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the associations of socio-demographic, physical, and psychological factors with loneliness. Results The mean level of loneliness did not significantly differ between men (17.0 ± 4.5) and women (17.5 ± 5.1). However, among the oldest old (≥85 years), loneliness was higher in women (p value = 0.047). Depression, low satisfaction with life, and low resilience were associated significantly with loneliness, which was more pronounced in men. Living alone was not associated with loneliness, whereas lower social network was associated with a three time higher risk for feeling lonely in both men and women. Conclusions The extent of loneliness was equally distributed between men and women, although women were more disadvantaged regarding living arrangements as well as physical and mental health. However, loneliness was stronger associated with adverse mental health conditions in men. These findings should be considered when developing intervention strategies to reduce loneliness.

187,Global sleep satisfaction of older people: The Jerusalem cohort study,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature of global sleep satisfaction (GSS) of older people and the factors associated with it. DESIGN: A 7-year follow-up of an age-homogenous cohort. SETTING: Community based. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety subjects aged 70 at baseline and 77 at follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported sleep domains and a comprehensive assessment of health variables, including psychosocial, physical, and functional factors, at ages 70 and 77. RESULTS: GSS was found to be poor in 25% of subjects at ages 70 and 77, with an estimated average annual remission rate of 7% and an annual incidence of 2.4%. Poor GSS at ages 70 and 77 was significantly associated with difficulty falling asleep, awakening feeling tired, two or more nocturnal awakenings, and taking sleeping tablets. Significant cross-sectional associations were found at age 70 and 77 between poor GSS and poor self-rated health, general fatigue, depression, dependence in one or more activities of daily living, and low level of physical activity. In a regression analysis, risk factors at age 70 for subsequent poor GSS were loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, obesity, and prior poor GSS. The only significant long-term association was between poor GSS and poor self-rated health. GSS did not influence mortality data. CONCLUSION: Poor GSS in older people is common and chronic. Its chief determinants are loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, and obesity. It predicts poor self-rated health but not increased mortality. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.243060294
374,Care of the elderly in general practice : A socio-medical reassessment,"There is a need for the development of a national policy to cope with the ever-increasing problems of our ageing population. It is also necessary to define the roles of the various bodies and individuals who are responsible for the care of the elderly at more local levels. In the development of any such policy a reassessment of the status and place of the elderly in our community must be carried out. Pensions must be provided to enable the old folk to live independently, comfortably, and respectably. The age for retirement must be carefully considered. In general the present official age of retirement is at least 10–15 years in advance of the natural old age of 70–75, when physical and mental disabilities become manifest. Every effort should therefore be made to encourage people to remain at work beyond the present retirement levels. A first principle in the care of the elderly is the encouragement and maintenance of mental and physical independence for as long as possible, and when this begins to fail then it is upon the family and the family doctor that the burden falls. The importance of the family is shown by the fact that in this suburban practice 86% of those over 70 years of age had regular contact with their families. The remaining 14%—the “ isolates ”—presented great problems when they fell ill. The family, whatever its importance, cannot these days be expected to provide alone all the care for the aged, and assistance is required, both social and medical, if it is to carry on its tasks. In arranging for these various forms of domiciliary helps the medical officer of health must occupy a vital place. He must act as a co-ordinator and as a consultant in social medicine and be available constantly to help the family doctor to provide all the ancillary services that may be necessary to keep the old patient at home and well cared for. In the actual management of the aged sick it is essential to realize that there are no special diseases of old age, but that its presentations are merely the results of modifications from degenerative processes. The commonest causes of morbidity and disablement were found to be cardiac failure, chronic bronchitis, and various forms of “ rheumatism.” The pitfalls in diagnosis and the scope of curative therapy are discussed. The family doctor should plan his work in this field essentially on a preventive basis by early diagnosis of curable major and minor disorders and by the prevention of social loneliness, boredom, and poverty. In carrying out these tasks the importance of establishing and maintaining close contact with one's ageing patients is stressed and the value of special clinics for the elderly is noted. The present is still a phase of transition in the development of the Welfare State ; the future presents great scope in the development of medical and social services to cope with the problems of the aged. © 1957, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

165,Psychosocial perspectives on health care utilization among frail elderly people: An explorative study,"The aim was to explore the relationship between health care utilization over 2 years and psychosocial variables measured at the end of this period in a sample of older people with high health care consumption. Sixty-three people aged 69-96 years were included in the study. Data were collected from two different registers covering health care utilization from 2004 to the end of 2008, and baseline data from an ongoing RCT. A cluster analysis (based on the health care utilization variables) was used to divide the sample into subgroups. The cluster analysis resulted in a two cluster and a three cluster solutions. The latter was found to be more appropriate because it more clearly discriminated between the groups regarding health care utilization and psychosocial variables. The three clusters were classified as "" high consumers"" (Cluster I), and "" low consumers"" (Clusters II and III). Cluster II seemed to be characterized by low outpatient but high inpatient care utilization, while the opposite utilization pattern can be seen in Cluster III, which also contained those with the largest social network, lowest risk of depression, highest life satisfaction and who felt least lonely. Cluster II contained those who felt the loneliest. Thus, older people whose health care consumption mainly comprises outpatient care appeared to have the least impact on the psychosocial variables (e.g., the highest life satisfaction, felt least lonely and were at the lowest risk of depression). Thus, measures taken to prevent health care utilization, especially among those with high utilization of inpatient care, will most likely have a positive effect on psychosocial variables and life satisfaction/quality of life (QoL). © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2450660384
181,Personal resources supporting living at home as described by older home care clients,"This study describes the personal resources of older (≥ 75 years) home care clients in Finland and their perceptions of factors that enhance and constrain their ability to live independently at home. The data were collected by unstructured interviews with 21 older home care clients. Inductive content analysis were used to analyse the data. The resources of older people consisted of a sense of control over one's life and a determination to remain active. Factors enhancing older people's resources were their involvement in leisure activities and social networks, factors undermining their resources were conditions on living imposed by outsiders, declining health and loneliness. The results show that home care professionals do not yet have sufficient skills and abilities to identify and support older people's existing resources. As well as having access to necessary resources, it is also crucial that older people know how to use them. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3460112311
234,The PAUL Suit©: An experience of ageing,"Background: An ageing population worldwide makes it increasingly important that health students understand issues that elderly people face and can provide empathic care to them. Context: This teaching department in an isolated rural setting developed an interprofessional learning session to assist health students to understand issues of functional loss and social isolation that can affect elderly people. Innovation: The Premature Ageing Unisex Leisure (PAUL) Suit© was developed as part of a 1-day learning session for undergraduate health students - including students of medicine, nursing and allied health - attending clinical placement in far-west New South Wales. The suit was developed locally and can be adjusted to simulate a wide range of functional losses in the wearer. Students undertake a range of daily tasks in the community while wearing the suit in the company of a student 'carer'. Over the past 4 years, approximately 140 students have participated in the simulation. Post-simulation evaluations report that students gain a greater understanding of some functional issues associated with ageing, and of the social isolation that can be associated with these. The experiential nature of the activity leads to some powerful insights. This activity is an innovative, experiential tool to deepen students understanding of issues related to ageing Implications: This activity is an innovative, experiential tool to deepen students understanding of issues relating to ageing. The interprofessional nature of the activity is an important factor in the success of the day, and produces a wide range of shared insights. The activity also enhances the partnerships between the university, the health service and the local community. Our experience supports the value of simulation in providing a deep learning opportunity in the area of ageing and disability. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,"not OA, not SI",1,,,,,0.4021074606
24,Designing interpersonal communication software for the abilities of elderly users,"Feelings of loneliness and social isolation can occur in many older adults - and impairments that may occur in old age, such as reduced mobility, deteriorating sight, and deteriorating hearing, can prevent elderly adults from visiting their friends and family. Interpersonal communication software -such as Facebook Messenger and Skype - can be very useful in keeping bonds with loved ones strong over long distances. However, sometimes these applications can be confusing and difficult for elderly people to use. A design created with considerations for the variety of abilities and older user may have could prompt more elderly users to use interpersonal communication software, and assist in the fight to reduce loneliness and social isolation in older adults. In this paper, we highlight a design for interpersonal communication software for elderly adults to use. Properly designed chat software would allow elderly users to quickly communicate with their friends via an interface designed with the different abilities of elderly users in mind. © 2014 IEEE.",0,0,"no intervention, no remote, no SI",0,,,,,0.1123315014
30,"Ageing, Leisure, and Social Connectedness: How could Leisure Help Reduce Social Isolation of Older People?","This study investigates the relation between leisure activities and the social status of the elderly based on a heterogeneous sample of the Dutch population. Close relationships are also analyzed to identify which people could serve as successful stimulators of leisure participation. The social profile confirms that older people have fewer social contacts and often feel lonely. This study shows that leisure activities explain a significant part of older people's social connectedness. Voluntary work, cultural activities, holiday, sports, reading books, hobbies and shopping are found to be successful predictors for social connectedness of older people. Watching TV, listening to the radio, and spending time behind the computer (passive activities) were not associated with social connectedness. Friends correlate positively to participation in leisure activities. Partners play a role in participation in cultural activities and sports; parents play a role in participation in voluntary work and holidays; siblings play a role in voluntary work and sports; and children play a role in cultural activities, reading books, and shopping. Local communities can use these close relationships and develop special programs to increase social connectedness and hence improve quality of life for older adults. © 2012 The Author(s).",0,0,"no intervention, no tech, no remote, no SI, survey",0,,,,,0.9490898193
318,A biopsychosocial model of religious involvement,"Numerous studies show that religious involvement tends to favor health and longevity in the elderly population. Although this body of work has made significant contributions to our understanding of the salutary role of religious involvement in late life, additional research is needed to identify and establish theoretical and empirical explanations for these patterns. In this chapter, I develop a biopsychosocial model of religious involvement, health, and longevity. The model incorporates several classes of mechanisms, including social resources, psychological resources, healthy behaviors, and biological markers. I conclude that additional research is needed to establish individual mechanisms, more elaborate causal models, and subgroup variations. It is also important for future studies to thoroughly explore the ""dark side"" of religion and to formally test alternative explanations, including health selection, personality selection, genetic selection, and social desirability. © 2010 Springer Publishing Company.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5756883314
179,"Loneliness, social support networks, mood and wellbeing in community-dwelling elderly","Objective: Both loneliness and social networks have been linked with mood and wellbeing. However, few studies have examined these factors simultaneously in community-dwelling participants. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between social network, loneliness, depression, anxiety and quality of life in community dwelling older people living in Dublin. Methods: One thousand two hundred and ninety-nine people aged 65 and over, recruited through primary care practices, were interviewed in their own homes using the GMS-AGECAT. Social network was assessed using Wenger's typology. Results: 35% of participants were lonely, with 9% describing it as painful and 6% as intrusive. Similarly, 34% had a non-integrated social network. However, the two constructs were distinct: 32% of participants with an integrated social network reported being lonely. Loneliness was higher in women, the widowed and those with physical disability and increased with age, but when age-related variables were controlled for this association was non-significant.Wellbeing, depressed mood and hopelessness were all independently associated with both loneliness and non-integrated social network. In particular, loneliness explained the excess risk of depression in the widowed. The population attributable risk (PAR) associated with loneliness was 61%, compared with 19% for non-integrated social network. Taken together they had a PAR of 70% Conclusions: Loneliness and social networks both independently affect mood and wellbeing in the elderly, underlying a very significant proportion of depressed mood.

287,"The effectiveness of physical exercise training in pain, mobility, and psychological well-being of older persons living in nursing homes","Pain is common in the aging population, particularly among older residents of nursing homes. It has been found that 50% of older people living in the community have been experiencing chronic pain, and the number increased to 80% for older residents of nursing homes. Exercise is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that can reduce pain and improve physical and psychological functions. A quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest control group designed was conducted to evaluate the effects of a physical exercise program (PEP) on older residents of nursing homes who have chronic pain. Three-hundred-ninety-six older residents with chronic pain were recruited from 10 nursing homes run by non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong. The average age of the older residents was 85.44±6.29. Five nursing homes were randomized to the experimental group with PEP (n=225, age=85.45±6.25); the other five nursing homes were randomized to the control group without the PEP (n=171, age=85.44±6.35). PEP was an eight-week training program given by a physiotherapist and nurses once a week. It consisted of warm-up exercises, muscle strengthening, stretching, balancing, and self-administered massage to acupressure points. At the end of each PEP session, pamphlets with pictures illustrating the ""exercise of the day"" were given to the older residents of nursing homes as a tool to enhance their self-management skills. The control group received no training during the eight weeks. Upon completion of the PEP, the experimental group experienced a significantly greater reduction in pain intensity from 4.19±2.25 (on an 11 point scale) to 2.67±2.08, as compared to the control group (p < .05). In addition, the psychological well-being (happiness, loneliness, life satisfaction, and depression) of the experimental group was significantly improved (p < .05). © 2014 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5480903156
354,Promoting mental health and wellbeing amongst housebound older people,"In England health promotion has an important role to play in delivering the aims of the new health and social care modernisation programme. Two health promotion strategies evident in recent policy documents concern the provision of good quality information and encouraging greater social participation. Providing information about health issues is intended to empower people, promote independence and help them to become, and stay, healthy. Encouraging social participation is intended to reduce social isolation and stress, build social capital, and promote mental health and wellbeing. This paper presents findings from a qualitative sociological study of an Ageing Well project for housebound older people relevant to these policy goals. The findings reveal what older people valued about participating in the project, and how it enhanced their sense of wellbeing. It is argued that, for this group of people, 'feeling happy' and maintaining a positive sense of wellbeing were transitory experiences involving a range of strategies to 'manage' information. The lessons for health promotion from this study suggest that providing health-related information may conflict with, rather than complement, efforts to promote mental health by compromising the ways in which people in difficult circumstances construct their sense of wellbeing and strive to feel happy. © Copyright - 2001 MCB UP Ltd.

62,Ageing well and learning through online immersive participation using a multi-user Web 3D environment,"The Second Life (SL) multi-user virtual environment offers researcher opportunities to experiment with its rich communication, virtual collaboration, and 3-D content creation integrated tools. The SL synthetic world has already revealed great potential for heritage, education and learning but much of the existing applications made have focused on engagement with digital native audiences. The contribution of this paper identifies the importance of developing and designing tailored virtual places which older members of society can utilize easily and safely within this context; with a focused application of addressing social isolation, enabling wellbeing and lifelong learning. In this paper we also discuss our experiences of introducing SL to an elderly community and imparting to them the skills required to interact within the 3D environment and the resources that we developed to support their induction and training. This paper explores the impact of this approach and signposts next steps in experimenting with the use of SL as a domesticated digital technology tool that offers potential to support Ageing Well in our Information Society.

359,Grief and older people: The making or breaking of emotional bonds following partner loss in later life,"The aim of this ethnographic study was to explore retrospectively the grief experiences of 12 older people whose partners had recently died in hospital, following a period of terminal illness. The rationale was based upon developing an understanding of the grief experiences of newly bereaved older people. In doing so, it is important to consider that grief is not only shaped by culture and social context but also by the nature of the relationship between the mourner and the deceased. For most of this century, the dominant conceptualization relating to grief and the social experience of bereavement has been based on the psychoanalytical school of thought. This process is said to involve the mourner passing through a number of stages or phases and forms the basis of the 'grief work hypothesis'. Using in-depth ethnographic interviews, the mourner's reactions to and perceptions of the loss were explored. Tape-recorded interview data were analysed using the inductive process of both content analysis and discourse evaluation. The findings from this study shed light on an area of conjugal bereavement that has received little attention in the past and challenges traditional models of grief. The indications are that in the first year of bereavement, the bereaved retain and modify the emotional relationship with their deceased partners, through a range of symbolic behaviours. The discussion raises issues concerning the need to consider the extent to which contemporary conceptualizations of grief explain the reactions of older people whose grief experiences are shaped by their social situation. The study also highlights important issues concerning the need to understand the complexity of grief experiences and bereavement support for older people which has a number of implications for nurses in both hospital and community settings.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3063021587
216,The situation of the elderly women - psychological and social aspects [DIE SITUATION DER ALTEREN FRAU - PSYCHOLOGISCHE UND SOZIALE ASPEKTE],"Based upon an analysis of empirical sociological and psychological research, the situation of older women in today's society is described. It becomes evident that a differentiated view is necessary. There is nothing like the old woman of today. Cohort-effects, and, besides these, marriage-status and occupation seem to have a marked influence on forms of adaptation to and of coping with age. Four topics are discussed in this paper. A change in the understanding of the female role, which is influenced in a noncontinuous way by situations like war or economic depressions; it presently seems to come back to its traditional forms. The image of old women is by far more negative than the image of old men. Besides this, aging seems to begin for women 10-15 years earlier than it does for men; this may be explained by the fact that the mother role is glorified in our society. As soon as tasks related to this role are fulfilled, which is generally in her forties, a woman has done services, and no longer needed. Effects of such negative components in the image of an aging woman on her behavior are discussed. Statistical figures very clearly show the disadvantages which single older women have to cope with. An accumulation of manifold disadvantages is found in widowed housewives who are not employed in any job. For a long time, research seemed unaware of the psychic situations of older women. Recent studies do show, however, that it is harder for an old woman to have a successful life, be it with regard to social interactions or isolation and loneliness, to aptitude and social or professional competence, or with regard to hobbies and interests. Here housewives with no professional training (and particularly the widows of this group) seem to endure the most obvious disadvantages; the proposition that occupational activity is a good geroprophylaxis receives new support.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7031606834
52,Lessons learnt from the socio-technical design of social TV services with elderly,"Encouraging elderly people to stay at home as long as possible is associated with a higher risk of social isolation. Nowadays, aging well at home cannot be reduced to the management of physical and cognitive frailties and technologies should also tackle the quality of life of the elderly by fostering their social interactions. However, designing appropriate services and ensuring their adoption remain open questions, to which we try to provide answers at the methodological and instrumental levels. The authors present here a Living Lab approach to design communication services for elderly people at home. They illustrate this approach by describing their participation in a European project aiming at developing and evaluating Social TV services and they conclude with recommendations for the successful socio-technical design of services that foster the social engagement of elderly people.

248,"In adolescence, female rats are more sensitive to the anxiolytic effect of nicotine than are male rats","Anxiety may play an important role in the onset of smoking, particularly in young girls. This study examined whether there were sex differences in the effects of nicotine on anxiety in adolescent rats and whether social isolation modified these effects. Male and female adolescent rats were housed in groups of the same sex or in social isolation for seven days prior to testing in the social interaction test of anxiety. Nicotine increased social interaction in both males and females, and because there was no concomitant change in locomotor activity, this indicated anxiolytic effects. However, there was a 5-fold sex difference in the lowest dose required to enhance social interaction, with an anxiolytic effect in females at 0.05mg/kg, but in males only at 0.25mg/kg. Furthermore, in males the anxiolytic effect was seen only in socially isolated animals, whereas in the females it was present in both housing conditions. The depressant effect of nicotine on locomotor activity also depended on both the sex of the animal and on their housing conditions, with greater effects in singly housed animals and in males. This sex difference in sensitivity to nicotine's anxiolytic effects suggests there may be sex differences in the factors initiating and maintaining teenage smoking. © 2001 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

60,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.955183554
158,Primary care and care for older persons: Position Paper of the European Forum for Primary Care,"This article explores how to address the needs of the growing number of older patients in primary care practice. Primary care is not a fixed organisational structure but a combination of functional characteristics which has developed variably in European countries with differing responses to the emerging needs of older persons. Multimorbidity, frailty, disability and dependence play out differently in older persons; a key challenge for primary care is to provide a response that is adapted to the needs of individuals - as they see them and not as the professional defines them. Indeed, growing experience shows how to involve older persons in taking decisions. Contrary to popular opinion, older persons often rate their quality of life as high. Indeed, comprehensive primary care offers health promotion and prevention: also older people may benefit from measures that support their health and independence and some case descriptions show this potential. Although most people prefer to be in their own environment (home, community) during the last stage of life, providing end-of-life care in the community is a challenge for primary care because it requires continuity and coordination with specialist care. Successful models of care however do exist. Delivering seamless integrated care to older persons is a central theme in primary care. Rather than disease management, in primary care, case management is the preferred approach. Proactive geriatric assessment of individual medical, functional and social needs, including loneliness and isolation, has been shown to be useful and its place in primary care is the subject of further research. Clinical practice guidelines for multimorbidity are badly needed. Non-adherence to medication, linked to multiple and uncoordinated prescriptions, is a widespread and costly problem. Successful approaches in primary care are being developed, including the use of electronic patient files. With the general practitioner (GP) as the central care provider, primary care is increasingly teamwork, and the role of nurses and other (new) professions in primary care is developing constantly. The composition and coordination of teams are two components of one of the major complexities to address: how to provide individualised care with standardisation at organisation the level. (Lack of) Coordination with specialist care remains a widespread problem and needs attention from policy makers and practitioners alike. Alignment with home care and social services remains a challenge in all countries, not least because of the different funding arrangements between the services. Further priorities for research and development are summarised. © 2011 Raddiffe Publishing.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.0228229137
170,Nowadays you don't even see your neighbours': Loneliness in the everyday lives of older Australians,"Loneliness is a pressing social issue for older people globally. Despite this, there is a paucity of studies on how older people themselves perceive loneliness and how service providers can support them. This study sought to address the gap using in-depth and semi-structured interviews with 60 older people and eight focus groups with aged care service providers in Australia in 2007. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to incorporate maximum participant variation. People 65 years and over were recruited from four large service providers in two Australian states. Our findings show that loneliness is influenced by private, relational and temporal dimensions and whether older people feel that they have, or are seen by others as having, a sense of connectedness with the wider community. Participants expressed the importance of maintaining social contact and having a sense of connection and belonging to the community. Our study highlights both the significance of gathering the views of older people to generate an understanding about loneliness and the need to recognise loneliness as a diverse and complex experience, bound to the context in which it is understood and perceived and not synonymous with social isolation. Such an understanding can be used to both evaluate and improve upon programmes that address loneliness and to help maintain an integration of older people in the community. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3383921929
315,Normal adult aging and the contextual influences affecting speech and meaningful sound perception,"It is widely accepted that hearing loss increases markedly with age, beginning in the fourth decade ISO 7029 (2000). Age-related hearing loss is typified by high-frequency threshold elevation and associated reductions in speech perception because speech sounds, especially consonants, become inaudible. Nevertheless, older adults often report additional and progressive difficulties in the perception and comprehension of speech, often highlighted in adverse listening conditions that exceed those reported by younger adults with a similar degree of high-frequency hearing loss (Dubno, Dirks, & Morgan) leading to communication difficulties and social isolation (Weinstein & Ventry). Some of the age-related decline in speech perception can be accounted for by peripheral sensory problems but cognitive aging can also be a contributing factor. In this article, we review findings from the psycholinguistic literature predominantly over the last four years and present a pilot study illustrating how normal age-related changes in cognition and the linguistic context can influence speech-processing difficulties in older adults. For significant progress in understanding and improving the auditory performance of aging listeners to be made, we discuss how future research will have to be much more specific not only about which interactions between auditory and cognitive abilities are critical but also how they are modulated in the brain. © The Author(s) 2010.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.09571555225
266,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.4774521114
195,"Living alone, social support, and feeling lonely among the elderly","This study aimed to describe the characteristics of the elderly population living alone, and to examine how living alone relates to feeling lonely. Interviews were conducted with a stratified random sample of 4,859 elderly individuals living in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Variables collected included demographic information, living alone or not, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), chronic conditions, perceived social support, and a subjective measure of feeling lonely. Using logistic regression, it was found that factors associated with living alone included gender, marital status, occupation, source of income, religion, and IADL. Living alone was, in turn, related to decreased levels of both perceived social support and feeling lonely after adjustment for potential confounders. Managing retired life is important for adult elders, particularly for men. Lack of social support is common among the elderly community who live alone, which could well be a main reason for this group to feel lonely. As loneliness is linked to physical and mental health problems, increasing social support and facilitating friendship should be factored into life-style management for communities of elderly.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.4852670323
110,"Housing priorities of people with dementia: Security, continuity and support","Overview: Over the past decade, dementia has gained prominence as a key health, aged care and social policy challenge. Dementia is predicted to become the leading cause of disability in Australia by 2016. Recent data analysis estimates that 298 000 Australians had dementia in 2011, with the number of people with dementia expected to reach almost 400 000 by 2020 (AIHW 2012, p.ix). Like other first world nations, Australia's population is ageing due to the combined effects of longevity and decreased fertility. Consequently prevalence of dementia is projected to increase into the future. AIHW (2012, p.ix) data indicates that the total direct health and aged care system expenditure on people with dementia in Australia in 2009-10 was at least $4.9 billion, of which about $2 billion was directly attributable to dementia. Dementia is an incurable syndrome that impacts on higher cognitive functions, behavioural and psychological traits, and physical function. It is terminal, but with varied trajectories of decline. While there is a comprehensive literature around managing dementia, to date, insights into the role of housing in supporting people living with dementia (PwD) and the planning and coordination of health and housing services has been limited. This project on the future housing and support needs of PwD begins to address this gap. The research has been structured around five major research questions: 1. What is known about the links between housing and care provision for people with dementia? 2. What are the current and projected living arrangements and housing pathways of people with 'mild, 'moderate' and 'severe' dementia in Australia? 3. To what extent are existing community care programs able to adequately support people with dementia effectively across a range of home settings, particularly those in low cost and insecure housing situations? 4. How do people's initial housing circumstances impact on their housing and care pathways, including their transition into residential care? 5. What policy responses and measures could better support practitioners, housing providers and family carers to respond effectively to the future housing and support needs of people with dementia? The research team relied on a mixed-method approach to answer these questions. In relation to the first two questions, the team undertook a comprehensive literature and policy review, as well as secondary data analysis of ABS and AIHW data. The results of this analysis were previously reported in a Positioning Paper (Gabriel et al. 2014). In relation to Research Questions 3, 4 and 5, the research team conducted interviews with relevant stakeholders across two study sites - South Australia (SA) and Tasmania. The research team consulted with 44 housing and community care service providers across 18 agencies between May and October 2014. The results of this analysis are reported in Chapter 3. The research team also consulted with PwD and their family carers. The team obtained insight into 12 people's experiences of living with dementia between August and December 2014. People's level of participation in the interview process varied. While in some instances PwD were able to actively participate and respond to questions, at other times the person with dementia was present but did not participate significantly. Four carers provided insight into their parent/partner's experience without their family member present. The results of this analysis are reported in Chapter 4. Stakeholder consultation: key findings: The stakeholder consultation, which forms the basis of Chapters 3 and 4, provides insight into the role of housing and support services in enabling PwD and their carers to retain quality of life. While many issues were canvassed in this wide-reaching and exploratory study, there were three recurring themes raised throughout the consultation. These include: the importance of secure housing, which over time has become a familiar and comforting home, in enabling PwD to maintain quality of life; the importance of continuity in both the home environment and the care received in the home in reducing anxiety; and the importance of comprehensive home-based care and community support (including innovative respite services) in enabling people to retain independence and dignity as they experience decline in their cognitive function. Housing security: Among stakeholders. there is growing recognition of the advantages of enabling PwD to remain in a familiar environment. A key element in achieving this continuity is housing security. Our consultation with service providers and carers highlighted the advantages of owning your own home and having access to housing wealth for families coping with the challenges and stress of dementia. People who own their own home are able to readily make appropriate home modifications to support their changing needs. They are also potentially able to afford extra home-based care and support if it is required as their condition progresses. In other circumstances, people who own their own home and who are able to access wealth are potentially able to seek alternative, more appropriate housing options within the housing market that can better support their needs. People living in public rental housing share in common with home owners high levels of housing security. However, the process of obtaining suitable home modifications and/or accessing alternative, more appropriate housing options is more complex and more constrained. While service providers noted that there was capacity to move tenants to more appropriate housing options, the availability of better designed housing and/or service-integrated housing was limited. Further, the possibility of tenants accessing extra home-based care and support as their condition progresses is less feasible due to financial constraints. In contrast, housing security was a significant concern for PwD who are living in private rental and/or marginal housing situations, such as caravan parks and boarding houses. The major concerns raised by service providers were the PwDs' capacity to maintain the tenancy due to: problems with maintaining the residence, confusion about lease arrangements and rental payments, and problems with affording increasing rent and utility bills. They also noted that marginal housing situations such as caravan parks and boarding houses were problematic for managing personal care and accessing home-based support. Service providers emphasised the importance of inter-agency collaboration and the need for ongoing case management to ensure that people with complex needs at risk of homelessness were able to continue to access the supports they required. Service providers also raised the problem of the lack of appropriate, affordable housing options for people who have complex needs and who are marginally housed. Without this, there can be a push towards transition into residential care. Service providers noted that an expansion of brain health initiatives among the homelessness population and the introduction of outreach cognitive screening would address current delays in people living in marginal and precarious housing situations receiving diagnosis and support. Across the two case sites examined, there was greater evidence of collaboration underway in South Australia, compared with Tasmania. PwD talked about their strong attachment to their home and neighbourhood, as well as happy memories from the past. Housing security was a critical issue for PwD and their carers. It was tied to people's sense of wellbeing and quality of life. The home is a place where PwD feel at ease and they can function well. PwD and their carers organise the home to compensate for loss of short term memory. Importantly, the home is often a repository of longer term memories. In contrast, the idea of change and moving home was a source of frustration and anxiety for many. Continuity in housing environment and home-based support: Stakeholders emphasised the importance of continuity in terms of the home environment and also continuity in terms of available supports and care. Continuity was viewed as critical in enabling people experiencing memory loss to maintain quality of life and in reducing anxiety and stress. Home modification was viewed as a critical component of enabling PwD to remain in their homes and to retain quality of life. Service providers were critical of current housing design, which focuses on aesthetics above function for older people including those with mobility and cognitive issues. Service providers emphasised the value of timely access to home modification. This did not always occur due to lack of education, lack of resources and waiting lists. They noted that modifications for PwD are most effective when they are tailored to the specific needs of the individual. This is a challenge for public and community housing providers who are operating with constrained and declining budgets. Service providers also highlighted current challenges with accessing appropriate levels of home-based support. They noted that there was a need to work with families and try to establish a good, working partnership. In situations where people are living alone, it is a challenge to provide adequate levels of care as their condition progresses. They identified gaps in service provision including the need for regular prompts to take medication, limited service access over the weekend, and shortfalls in adequate respite care. Service providers also cited examples of discriminatory practices that impact on people's capacity to age in place within retirement village developments. There is a need for further research into barriers to ageing in place for PwD in retirement village settings. Family carers observed that any potential changes can be distressing for care-recipients: changes in care staff, changes in care routines, and conversations about moving house or into residential care. Family carers wanted care-recipients to remain at home in an environment that is familiar to them and which makes them feel good for as long as possible. However, children who were carers and in separate dwellings also expressed concerns about their parents' safety and capacity to manage alone. Many of the carers had made modifications to the bathroom to support care-recipients' independence with showering and toileting. Carers played an important role in making minor changes to the home environment to help the PwD to orientate themselves around the home and to reduce the risk of accidents. Providing continuity in the housing and support environment was recognised as problematic for particular groups in the community. Consultation highlighted that there are specific issues around communication and dementia in CALD communities and consequently that there is a need for specialised support services. In addition, service providers highlighted the challenges associated with supporting PwD who live in rural and regional areas to age in place. Major issues included a lack of diverse and appropriate community services that can reduce social isolation, the costs involved in delivering care in the home in regional locations, and the additional requirements of travel to access community and health services. Comprehensive home-based and community support: Service providers noted that in the past dementia was heavily stigmatised and a diagnosis of dementia was often made in late stages. Diagnosis was therefore often associated with significant and rapid decline in cognitive function and a pathway to residential care, but this situation is changing. Increased awareness of dementia and increased access to diagnostic services has seen earlier diagnoses of dementia. However, service providers highlighted that there remained scope for increasing awareness of the importance of early diagnosis in order to access appropriate support and maintain quality of life. Service providers noted that there was a need for increased awareness about dementia and the pathways to assessment within the social housing and homelessness sector. This is important in enabling service providers to respond appropriately to complex situations where mental health issues, memory loss and a dementia condition may be present. It is also important in achieving inter-agency collaboration and enabling PwD to access appropriate, stable housing and support services in a timely way. It was recognised by housing providers that structural changes in the public housing sector were impacting on the capacity of staff to provide adequate duty of care towards older tenants. This was a concern in Tasmania where recent structural changes had resulted in State Housing Authority (SHA) staff having reduced knowledge of and engagement with tenants. SA has also experienced some rationalisation of services, however, participants were optimistic that tenancy support would be targeted towards those in need, including older tenants. Service providers observed that the home-based care landscape was also changing with the introduction of Consumer Directed Care (CDC). In general, participants recognised the value of enabling clients and carers to be involved in developing a tailored package of services that might best support the individual person's circumstances and meet their personal care needs. However, participants also noted that the issue of choice was problematic for PwD. While a carer would be able to advocate for their care-recipient, a person living alone would need access to an advocate or would rely on trusted service providers to assist with this process. Participants were also concerned that in an environment that encourages competition between service providers and a focus on discrete service activities, some of the things that are less tangible and not easily calculated, such as building trust and rapport between clients, carers and service providers, might disappear. In particular, participants noted that CDC was problematic for vulnerable people living in marginal housing situations. Carers valued any home-based support they could access to reduce their care burden. However, they saw gaps in the range of services offered. They wanted help with: transport, the preparation of nutritious meals in the home, podiatry services, and a more comprehensive home-based service to manage medication and health needs. Carers were also concerned about being able to readily access information about their options. They felt that they were not being provided with an overview of the range of home-based support services available. When they asked for information, they were referred to online content, pamphlets and/or telephone numbers, but what they wanted was face-to-face, human support. This was important as they were time poor and they were struggling to absorb information during a time of emotional upheaval. © 2015, Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.

140,Loneliness in care homes: A neglected area of research?,"Approximately 5% of older people, those aged 65 years and over, in developed countries live in care homes and these represent the frailest and most vulnerable members of this population group. Levels of morbidity, especially dementia and cognitive impairment, are high, making it challenging to conduct research with these population groups. Loneliness is a debilitating condition with important negative outcomes in terms of both quality of life and wider health outcomes. The prevalence of severe loneliness among older people living in care homes is at least double that of community-dwelling populations: 22-42% for the care population compared with 10% for the community population. However, the evidence-base for the care home group is tentative as it is based upon a very limited empirical base of only five studies. This review failed to identify compelling evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to remediate loneliness in care home populations. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3875690491
384,Impact of mobile phone usage on social loneliness of elderly in Beijing,"Purpose: Using a mobile phone has become an essential activity for the elderly community. With improvements in mobile phone technology, the elderly can communicate with their children or friends conveniently, which can improve their life satisfaction and subjective well-being1,2. This paper aims to describe changes in the elderly's use of mobile phones in 2010 and measure the association between use of mobile phones and social loneliness3. Method: Based on the 2010 ""Survey of the Older Population in Rural and Urban Beijing"", this paper focuses on a descriptive analysis of use of mobile phone to analyze older people's changing behaviors and then discusses the association between their mobile phone usage and social loneliness. Mobile phones can help the elderly obtain information and establish connections. This paper introduces the concept of 'social loneliness' as the most important reference of connection between the elderly and the society, and it has been operated as a subjective feeling question, namely the dependent variable. Results & Discussion: According to data analysis, mobile phones have become popular among the elderly. Only 44.3% of the elderly used mobile phones in 2006, but the number increased to 68.6% in 2010. As shown in Table 1, when demographic variables were controlled, mobile phone usage has a significant impact on social loneliness of the elderly. The more often old people use mobile phones, the less social loneliness they feel. The result shows that the necessity of using mobile phones for the elderly.

Memories were classified in terms of the psychosocial stages to which their content corresponded. For the majority of memories it was found that age at encoding corresponded to when specific psychosocial stages would have been most likely to have occurred. In a second experiment older adults recalled memories to cues drawn from psychosocial stages and the same pattern of findings was observed. These findings demonstrate that the goals of the self play a major role in both the encoding and accessibility of autobiographical memories, and they also provide support for Erikson's psychosocial theory of development (1950, 1997).",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2104357503

It also examines associations between network types and well-being indicators: loneliness, anxiety, and happiness.Design and Methods:A subsample of persons aged 65 years and older from the first wave of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project was employed (N = 1,462). We applied K-means cluster analysis to derive social network types using 7 criterion variables. In the multivariate stage, the well-being outcomes were regressed on the network type construct and on background and health characteristics by means of logistic regression.Results:Five social network types were derived: ""diverse,"" ""friend,"" ""congregant,"" ""family,"" and ""restricted."" Social network type was found to be associated with each of the well-being indicators after adjusting for demographic and health confounders. Respondents embedded in network types characterized by greater social capital tended to exhibit better well-being in terms of less loneliness, less anxiety, and greater happiness.Implications:Knowledge about differing network types should make gerontological practitioners more aware of the varying interpersonal milieus in which older people function. Adopting network type assessment as an integral part of intake procedures and tracing network shifts over time can serve as a basis for risk assessment as well as a means for determining the efficacy of interventions. © 2011 The Author.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.02601264397
329,Self-reported lack of energy (anergia) among elders in a multiethnic community,"Background. Lack of energy, ""anergia,"" is a possible central feature for identifying, evaluating, and treating elders with health-related problems in quality of life. Methods. A survey was conducted on a randomly selected stratified sample (N = 2130) of three ethnic groups of community-residing elders in a defined urban geographic area: the Northern Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP). The participants were Medicare beneficiaries living north of 150th Street in Manhattan. The criteria for anergia were based on the presence of the major criterion ""sits around a lot for lack of energy"" and any two of six minor criteria. Self-reports were gathered using a computer-assisted, rater-administered interview (the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Interview; CARE) covering: function (basic activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL [IADL]); features of geriatric syndromes such as self-rated physical health, depression, pain, respiratory distress, trouble sleeping, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular syndromes; social isolation; and healthcare utilization. Short-term (18-month) and long-term (6-year) mortality were derived from the National Death Index. Results. Three hundred eighty-six people (18% of the sample) met criteria for anergia. Anergia was more common in women than men (22% vs 12%, p &lt; .01), in unmarried than in married persons (21% vs 13%, p &lt; .001), and with advancing age. People with anergia used more hospitalizations, office visits, emergency room visits, and home care services and, had higher mortality rates. In multivariate analyses, the following factors had independent associations with anergia: female gender, impaired physical function and IADL, depression, pain, respiratory symptoms, urinary incontinence, hearing difficulty, feeling dizzy or weak, and social isolation and disengagement. These factors could be the initial candidates for clinical investigation of anergia of undetermined origin. Among people with anergia at baseline, 31.3% (n = 121) had persistent anergia and 33.9% (n = 131) recovered over a follow-up period of 18 months. Conclusions. Anergia in multiethnic older adults is associated with a range of clinical symptoms and diseases, with extensive health services use, and with increased mortality.

232,The impact of job strain on social isolation: A longitudinal analysis of French workers,"Numerous studies have shown that work may have an impact on social identity and social functioning in the community. Since work organisation in our society has gone through some profound changes in the last few decades, it is important to study the effect of these new constraints on the social life of people and, thereby, on their health. Using data from a French longitudinal cohort study on work, health and ageing (ESTEV), this paper analyses the impact of job strain on social isolation, in a sample of 16,950 individuals who were working in 1990 and 1995. The results show that low-decision latitude was associated with a significantly higher level of social isolation in both men and women. When compared with low job strain, active work (high-psychological demand and high-decision latitude) and high job strain were associated among men with a significantly higher level of social isolation. This study shows that a change in psychosocial work conditions (demand and control) had an impact on social isolation and that this impact may be more significant in male workers than in female workers. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

327,"Deprivation, demography, and the distribution of general practice: Challenging the conventional wisdom of inverse care","It is generally believed that the most deprived populations have the worst access to primary care. Lord Darzi's review of the NHS responds to this conventional wisdom and makes a number of proposals for improving the supply of GP services in deprived communities. This paper argues that these proposals are based on an incomplete understanding of inverse care which underestimates the degree to which, relative to their healthcare needs, older populations experience low availability of primary care. Many deprived practices appear to have a better match between need and supply than practices serving affluent but ageing populations. However, practices serving the oldest and most deprived populations have the worst availability of all. © British Journal of General Practice.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.08967359806

Using qualitative observational data from a longitudinal study of the impact of ICT usage on the quality of life among residents in assisted and independent living communities, the authors examine whether ICTs can mitigate the effects of social and spatial barriers.

Although the transition from informal (home-based) care to formal (institutional) care is often a function of dementia stage, for those with early dementia there is currently no definitive evidence showing that informal or formal care provides a higher QoL, particularly where informal care is favored for local cultural reasons. This paper outlines the research protocol for a study comparing formal and informal care in Malaysia. It seeks to provide evidence regarding which is more appropriate and results in higher QoL in early dementia. Methods: This is a quasi-experimental study design involving 224 early dementia patients from both nursing home and community settings. Participants will be assessed for cognitive severity, QoL, needs, activities of daily living, depression and social isolation/connectedness by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Impairment Scale - 4 items (CIS-4), EUROPE Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life (WHO8), Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL8), Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly - Short Version (CANE-S), Barthel Index (BI), Cornell Scale for Depression (CSDD), Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 items (GDS-15), and Friendship Scale (FS) respectively. Conclusion: This study aims to provide a better understanding of care needs in early dementia. Given population aging, the study findings will provide evidence assisting decision-making for policies aimed at reducing the burden of caregiving and preserving the QoL of dementia patients. © Copyright International Psychogeriatric Association 2011.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.8785749295
23,Automated behavioral mapping for monitoring social interactions among older adults,"Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces is a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote socialization in shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. In order to understand socializations in these shared spaces, surveillance systems must be developed to quantify the number and type of interactions in an environment. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using multiple cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an automatic behavioral mapping surveillance system designed for monitoring interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. Specific emphasis is given to the system designed to monitor the number, length and type of interactions of older adults in the community. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,"no intervention, no remote, no SI",0,,,,,0.234589685
171,I dont think they knew we could do these sorts of things: Social representations of community and participation in community arts by older people,"As people age the character of their social relationships change. There is evidence that older people who reside in disadvantaged communities often experience social isolation, which in turn has been found to be associated with a variety of health problems. This article reports the initial findings from a participatory arts project with a group of older residents of a disadvantaged urban community. It describes how the older residents represented their community and how they perceived the community arts intervention. © 2010 SAGE Publications.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.8146308933
383,Internet use and loneliness in older adults,"Use of the Internet by seniors as a communication technology may lead to changes in older adult social relationships. This study used an online questionnaire to survey 222 Australians over 55 years of age on Internet use. Respondents primarily used the Internet for communication, seeking information, and commercial purposes. The results showed negative correlations between loneliness and well-being. Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater use of the Internet as a communication tool was associated with a lower level of social loneliness. In contrast, greater use of the Internet to find new people was associated with a higher level of emotional loneliness. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.9633524611
17,Examining social media use among older adults,"Social media is a powerful tool that can connect family and friends across long distances as well as link people with similar interests. Social media has been widely adopted by younger adults, but older adults have been less likely to use such applications. A survey of 142 older adults (Mage=72 years, SD=11; range: 52-92) living in the metropolitan Atlanta area was conducted to understand the characteristics of older adults who do and do not use Facebook, a popular and wide-spread social media application. The present study examined the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness, social satisfaction, and confidence with technology. Demographic relationships were also examined, such as gender and age. Fifty-nine participants (42%) identified themselves as current Facebook users; 83 participants (58%) were not Facebook users. Non-Facebook users were significantly older (Mage= 75.3 years) than Facebook users (Mage= 66.5 years). Counter to expectations, there was not a significant difference in loneliness between Facebook users and non-users for this sample. However, Facebook users did score higher on assessments of social satisfaction and confidence with technology than did nonusers. These preliminary results suggest that many older adults do use Facebook and they primarily use it to stay connected with family. As adults enter into older adulthood, maintaining social connectedness may become more difficult due to mobility limitations, chronic diseases, and other age-related issues, thus decreasing physical connectedness with friends, family, and community. For these reasons, social media may begin to play a more active role in keeping this population socially connected. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence social media use in older adults is becoming more critical. Copyright 2013 ACM.",0,1,no intervention,0,,,,,0.2002540908
12,The PRISM clinical field trial to enhance well-being of older adults at risk for social isolation,"Purpose: An increasingly important public health issue is ensuring that the growing population of older adults has the capacity to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life. Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older people and enhancing their capacity to live independently. The objective of the PRISM trial is to gather rigorous evidence about the value of a technology application, the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), which is designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities, and access to resources. Method: The study design was a three-site randomized field trial. Following a baseline assessment, which included measures of demographics, health, prior technology experience, computer attitudes and proficiency, cognitive abilities, social support, and well-being, participants were randomly assigned to the PRISM condition or a Binder condition. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12 months post randomization. Participants also received a telephone interview at 18 months. Results & Discussion: Three hundred adults (aged 64-98 years) were randomized into the trial (150 participants in each condition). The sample is predominantly female, ethnically diverse, and from lower income strata. Although the majority of the sample population had minimal or no prior computer/internet experience, we were able to train all participants in the use of PRISM. The initial data indicate that the participants assigned to the PRISM condition enjoyed using the software and perceived it as valuable. They indicated that using PRISM facilitates their ability to connect or re-connect with family and friends, access community resources, and find information about topics of interest. The data also indicate that using PRISM resulted in re- duced feelings of social isolation and enhanced social support. Overall the data suggest that technology holds promise in terms of enhancing the well-being of older adults.",1,1,INCLUDED but too short,1,1,1,1,1,0.6595428936
288,Christian worship leaders' attitudes and observations of people with dementia,"Background: The cognitive, emotional, and psychological consequences of dementia are profound and can include memory loss, processing and, communication difficulties, social isolation and agitation. Procedural memory remains fairly intact in people with dementia (PWD) and is readily triggered via sensory cues and prompts. As religious services are often highly structured, it is likely that PWD can participate competently, potentially enhancing their quality of life, and wellbeing. Aims: This study aimed to investigate Christian worship leaders' attitudes and observations of PWD attending religious services, to identify recurring themes, and to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of participation in religious services on PWD. Method: The participants were Christian worship leaders experienced in conducting religious services for PWD. The study adopted a grounded theory approach consisting of two phases: a focus group of four worship leaders at Phase 1 and a series of one-to-one interviews with eight worship leaders at Phase 2. Results: Five linked themes emerged: familiarity and structure; enhanced sensory cues; significance of worship leader's approach; social support from and for family and carers; and the personality and characteristics of the PWD. These themes were used to develop a conceptual model, sharing the moderating and mediating factors of wellbeing.Conclusion:Religious worship appeared to constitute a naturalistic psychosocial intervention comprised of the service itself and the social context. Further investigation and conceptualisation of the interaction between PWD and their social environment is warranted, and collaboration with those people who constitute the PWD's social support network. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1614101503
310,Does caring for a spouse with dementia promote cognitive decline? A hypothesis and proposed mechanisms,"Objective: To discuss why spouse caregivers (CGs) of people with dementia may be at higher risk for cognitive problems and decline than demographically similar people not caring for a spouse with dementia (noncaregivers; NCGs). Design: Literature review. Setting: Community. Participants: Older adults caring for a family member (primarily spouses) with dementia. Measurements: Cognitive, psychosocial, physiological, and behavioral. Results: This article reports a review of the literature examining relationships between CG status and cognitive problems in the context of a theoretical model of chronic stress. The model suggests that spouse CGs may be at higher risk of cognitive impairment or dementia than NCG spouses in response to several mediators, including psychosocial (e.g., depression, loneliness, social isolation, sleep problems), behavioral (e.g., exercise, diet), and physiological (e.g., metabolic syndrome and inflammation) variables. Conclusion: This research has important implications because it considers modifiable risk factors for dementia that, if unchecked, may compromise the lives of CGs and their ability to function. It is hoped that an understanding of such stress-mediator-cognitive processes will help clinicians, researchers, policy-makers, and stakeholders mitigate what may be characterized as an ""ironic tragedy""-dementia in both members of the caregiving dyad-if left unchecked. © 2011, The American Geriatrics Society.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1854514191
175,User involvement in the development of a health promotion technology for older people: Findings from the SWISH project,"Successive English government policies about older people's health and well-being aim to improve health and quality of life by promoting independence. Improving access to information and services that can improve health and well-being and reduce health risks is central to the modernisation of health and social care. Most recently, tailored and person-centred approaches with a strong emphasis on promoting health and well-being are central to policy, including the proposals for 'Life Checks' and the recent emphasis on commissioning 'community well-being'. We carried out a qualitative study to identify the key aspects of social situations that affect health and well-being, from the perspectives of older people and professionals, to enrich and expand an existing health risk appraisal tool so that it could be used for self-assessment of health and social well-being. This tool, Health Risk Appraisal in Older people (HRAO), has been evaluated in different European settings, including English general practice. Focus groups were recruited from general practice, older people's forums, social care and voluntary organisations in two London boroughs where the HRAO tool had previously been tested. The social factors determining health that were prioritised by older people and service providers and recommended for inclusion in the health risk appraisal tool were recent life events, housing and garden maintenance, transport, both public and private, financial management, carer status and needs, the local environment and social networks and social isolation. This study has identified key social determinants of health that could usefully be added to 'Life Checks' for older people and that could also inform the commissioning of community well-being. Modified with the addition of social domains, the HRAO technology could be a suitable tool to achieve current policy objectives. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.8271107503
2,Gerontechnology companion: Virutal pets for dementia patients,"As the population of older adults, ages 65 and older, rises from 39.6 million in 2009 to approximately 72.1 million by 2030, there is a need to meet this aging imperative and develop age sensitive services. Technology is seizing the opportunity to make a difference in the quality of life of these individuals. With the introduction of user friendly tablets and interactive applications the geriatric populous, their families and the medical community can benefit from programs such as the Gerijoy Companion. The companion application utilizes a touch screen tablet's microphone and video camera to enhance the experience of the elder. The companion can be installed on any android device that has Wi-Fi or GSM compatibility. Using a consistent internet connection, every action and conversation an elder has with the companion is recorded inside a database in order to create a long lasting relationship with the elder. The companion can save lists of emergency numbers to be contacted if the need arises. More importantly, the person on the other side of the tablet can visually identify whether the elder has experienced any physical heads injuries. Caregivers and family members can participate by uploading photos into their elder's account or submitting important information the live person, the ""Gerijoy helper"" may need to know. Currently, the research being conducted is with community dwelling older adults who live alone and are experiencing loneliness, depression, and / or a decline in cognitive abilities related to some form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. A complete health history is recorded along with an initial depression and cognitive assessment. A follow-up assessment of depression and cognition is taken at a later date to secure information on the progress of the individual related to their use of the Gerijoy Companion. This data will be compiled to confirm the benefits of this application. Through conversation and photographs, the elder client can remain grounded in reality; this may slow down the progression cognitive deficits that are associated with dementia and depression. Gerijoy has already made a significant impact in the quality of life for the seniors who have participated in the program, family members and caregivers have expressed that their loved ones quality of life has improved. The elder clients' disposition and attitudes became happier as they made more contact with the community and their families. The need for technology to enhance the life of the geriatric population is a great opportunity for the future and we are doing our part to make a difference now and in the future. © 2014 IEEE.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.2179959424
254,A home-based individualized information communication technology training program for older adults: A demonstration of effectiveness and value,"Purpose: To demonstrate the effectiveness and value of a home-based information communication technology (ICT) training program for older adults. Methods: Thirteen older adults were provided in-home ICT training by graduate occupational therapy students using an iPad. The breadth and frequency of ICT use, perspectives on technology, and perceived independence were recorded at baseline, during the 3-month training and at follow-up, along with an end-of-study questionnaire. Non-parametric Friedman analysis was conducted to verify trends in the outcome measures. The qualitative data were examined by content analysis. Results: Participants breadth of ICT activities showed a significant trend across 6 months. Leisure accounted for the significant increase, while health management and social connections activities increased modestly. A positive trend in participants perspectives on technology was evident along with a marginal increase in perceived independence. Participants perspectives were thematically categorized as technology experiences, interactions with coach, training approach, and specific activities. As reflection of the training programs value, 12 of the 13 participants took ownership of the iPad at the end of the study. Conclusion: Building capacity of older adults to utilize the multifaceted potential of ICT is critical in addressing declines in health, impending disabilities, and social isolation. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.8947313148
300,The impact of hearing loss on the quality of life of elderly adults,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in the elderly, and it is becoming a severe social and health problem. Especially in the elderly, hearing loss can impair the exchange of information, thus significantly impacting everyday life, causing loneliness, isolation, dependence, and frustration, as well as communication disorders. Due to the aging of the population in the developed world, presbycusis is a growing problem that has been reported to reduce quality of life (QoL). Progression of presbycusis cannot be remediated; therefore, optimal management of this condition not only requires early recognition and rehabilitation, but it also should include an evaluation of QoL status and its assessment. © 2012 Ciorba et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.62272622
157,"Loneliness, depression, social support, and quality of life in older chronically ill appalachians","This study's purpose was to describe loneliness and to examine the relationships between loneliness, depression, social support, and QOL in chronically ill, older Appalachians. In-person interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 60 older, chronically ill, community-dwelling, and rural adults. Those with dementia or active grief were excluded. The UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1985), Geriatric Depression Scale (Shiekh & Yesavage, 1986), Katz ADL scale (Katz, Down, & Cash, 1970), MOS Social Support Scale (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991), and a visual analog scale for Quality of Life (Spitzer et al., 1981) scale were used. Diagnoses were obtained through chart reviews. SPSS was used for data analyses. The majority of the 65% female sample (M age = 75 years) were married and impoverished. Participants number of chronic illnesses averaged more than 3. Over 88% of participants reported at least 1 area of functional impairment. Loneliness was prevalent with UCLA loneliness scores indicating moderate to high loneliness, ranging from 39 to 62 (possible scores were 20-80). Higher loneliness scores correlated with depression, lower Qol, and lower social support, particularly lower emotional support. This study provides evidence that loneliness is a significant problem for older chronically ill Appalachian adults and that it may be related to low emotional support. Further, it provides evidence that this population may be significantly lonely and may not self-identify as lonely. Screening for loneliness and designing interventions that target the emotional aspects of loneliness could be important in this population. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6389514944
231,Aging-related changes in the effects of social isolation on social behavior in rats,"Aging is generally associated with cognitive dysfunction and alterations in emotional response. Moreover, in social situations, aging decreases social interaction with unfamiliar individuals, suggesting the decline of social cognition/motivation and a high level of anxiety. Although it is known that isolation housing has various effects on subsequent behavior, including social interaction depending on the age at isolation, the effects of isolation on aged subjects have not been examined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of aging and different periods of isolation housing on social interaction in male F344/N rats. Young (3-4. months old) and aged (24-25. months old) rats were either group-housed or socially isolated for 2 or 4. weeks. The rats were tested with age-matched and group-housed unfamiliar males in a social interaction test, and social (e.g. approach/following and sniffing) and non-social behaviors (e.g. self-grooming and ambulation) were recorded. The results indicated that group-housed aged rats showed less approach/following, sniffing, and ambulation than group-housed young rats. Moreover, in young rats, isolation housing gradually increased approach/following and sniffing depending on the isolation period. In contrast, in aged rats, more prolonged isolation (4. weeks) attenuated the 2-week isolation-induced increase of sniffing behavior and had no effect on approach/following. The present study suggests that aging decreases social investigation and induces high emotional response to a novel social environment, and that the behaviors can be differentially affected by social isolation depending on the age at isolation and the period of isolation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.4267710371

However, one can delay aging by leading a healthy life, regular exercising and making staying in good health one's goal in life. Music therapy employs music and its constituents, such as sounds, rhythm, motion, play of musical instruments and singing, for psychomotor, emotional and intellectual activation of a human being. It aims at releasing imagination, recollection of memories and mood improvement. By ensuring contact with art such as a piece of music, music therapy satisfies one's esthetic needs in terms of experiencing beauty that can reach even the deepest spheres of human personality and spirituality. Common experiencing of music can encourage one to share their experiences with others and explore their experiences, which strengthens social bonds and prevents loneliness. It can also arouse a need for contact with other spheres of art and prompt one to think about the meaning of human existence.",0,0,"no intervention, no tech, no remote, no SI",0,,,,,0.1969317684
339,Lots of little kindnesses': Valuing the role of older Australians as informal volunteers in the community,"This paper describes the ways in which older people contribute to their communities and families as informal volunteers. It challenges current ways of thinking that assign an economic value to the productive activities undertaken by older people. Using qualitative data from a study of older people resident in Queensland, Australia, the paper explores the ways that older people contribute to their families and to the community and the outcomes associated with these activities. Two specific themes emerged from the data: first, the ways in which older people contribute to strong inter-generational relations, and second, how they provide essential mutual support that permits many older people to remain living in the community. These contributions, while often small in themselves, are in aggregate critical both to family functioning and to the maintenance of sustainable and healthy communities. Many are reciprocal interactions that add value to the lives of individuals and offer positive social roles in later life, and they may be particularly important for those from minority cultural backgrounds or at risk of social isolation. The findings suggest that older people are integral to community and civil society and, therefore, that social policy should respond to the ageing of Australia's population and recognise the positive contributions of older people, rather than emphasising the costs of demographic change. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8049855463
270,Internet use and decision making in community-based older adults,"Use of the internet may provide tools and resources for better decision making, yet little is known about the association of internet use with decision making in older persons. We examined this relationship in 661 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of aging. Participants were asked to report if they had access to the internet and how frequently they used the internet and email. A 12-item instrument was used to assess financial and healthcare decision making using materials designed to approximate those used in real world settings. Items were summed to yield a total decision making score. Associations were tested via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and a measure of global cognitive function. Secondary models further adjusted for income, depression, loneliness, social networks, social support, chronic medical conditions, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), life space size, and health and financial literacy. Interaction terms were used to test for effect modification. Almost 70% of participants had access to the internet, and of those with access, 55% used the internet at least several times a week. Higher frequency of internet use was associated with better financial and healthcare decision making (β = 0.11, p = 0.002). The association persisted in a fully adjusted model (β = 0.08, p = 0.024). Interaction models indicated that higher frequency of internet use attenuated the relationships of older age, poorer cognitive function, and lower levels of health and financial literacy with poorer healthcare and financial decision making. These findings indicate that internet use is associated with better health and financial decision making in older persons. Future research is required to understand whether promoting the use of the internet can produce improvements in healthcare and financial decision making. © 2013 James, Boyle, Yu and Bennett.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.6253989534
61,Enhancing social interaction between older adults and their families,"The rise of Internet and ubiquitous technologies have spread and diversified the social media used by people to interact among them. Unfortunately most older adults are not able to use these solutions. This situation isolates them and negatively affects their physical and mental health. Aiming to improve mood in older adults, and helping them overcome the negative effects of social isolation, we have developed a computer-based intermediary system, that we called Social Connector. This system is capable of boosting the social interaction between an elder and his/her close relatives; e.g. adult children and grandchildren. The system can also be used as a sensor of elders' social interactions and mood. The preliminary evaluation results indicate that the system is well accepted by older adults, and it can be used to boost social interactions with their relatives. © Springer International Publishing 2013.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.5464161137
141,How community-dwelling seniors with multimorbidity conceive the concept of mental health and factors that may influence it: A phenomenographic study,"Multimorbidity, that is, the coexistence of chronic diseases, is associated with mental health issues among elderly people. In Sweden, seniors with multimorbidity often live at home and receive care from nursing aides and district nurses. The aim of this study was to describe the variation in how community-dwelling seniors with multimorbidity perceive the concept of mental health and what may influence it. Thirteen semi-structured interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic approach. Six qualitatively different ways of understanding the concept of mental health and factors that may influence it, reflecting key variations of meaning, were identified. The discerned categories were: mental health is dependent on desirable feelings and social contacts, mental health is dependent on undesirable feelings and social isolation, mental health is dependent on power of the mind and ability to control thoughts, mental health is dependent on powerlessness of the mind and inability to control thoughts, mental health is dependent on active behaviour and a healthy lifestyle, and mental health is dependent on passive behaviour and physical inactivity. According to the respondents' view, the concept of mental health can be defined as how an individual feels, thinks, and acts and also includes a positive as well as a negative aspect. Social contacts, physical activity, and optimism may improve mental health while social isolation, ageing, and chronic pain may worsen it. Findings highlight the importance of individually definitions of mental health and that community-dwelling seniors with multimorbidity may describe how multiple chronic conditions can affect their life situation. It is essential to organize the health care system to provide individual health promotion dialogues, and future research should address the prerequisites for conducting mental health promotion dialogues.

138,Homebound status increases death risk within two years in the elderly: Results from a national longitudinal survey,"Homebound status is associated with poorer physical and mental health, as well as disability in the elderly. We aimed to examine the prevalence and the role of homebound status on mortality in a representative sample of the French non-institutionalized population. This study included 7497 people aged 65 and over who were interviewed in 1999 and 2001 about the consequences of health problems on activities of daily living. Homebound status was defined as staying permanently inside the home, excluding an accident or a temporary illness. The influence of the homebound status on two-year mortality was assessed in a logistic regression model adjusted for the main confounders (age, sex, living as a couple, physical and mental impairments). The prevalence of homebound status was 4.7% (95% CI: 3.9-5.4) in this study. The number of homebound elderly was estimated at 421. 000 in France. The prevalence of homebound status increases with age and reaches 33.9% in people aged 95-99 years (95% CI: 13.1-54.6). Compared to non-homebound subjects, homebound elderly were more likely to be female, widower, to live alone and to have had a former low level job. Homebound status was associated with a number of physical and mental impairments. It increased the risk of dying within two years with an adjusted OR 3.45 (95% CI: 2.66-4.46). Homebound status should be considered as an indicator of frailty and used in the identification of old people likely to benefit from preventive interventions. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.9283481707
302,Impression management work: How seniors with chronic pain address disruptions in their interactions,"Chronic pain is an illness that affects nearly a third of senior citizens. Uncontrolled chronic pain can manifest constantly and/or intermittently, and can disrupt seniors' ability to plan or to maintain synchronous and scheduled contact with others. Such disruptions can expose seniors to stigma from others who do not understand this illness, social isolation, and a range of challenges to their social autonomy. We present results from an interview study of 27 seniors with chronic pain exploring how they mitigate and manage these disruptions in their lives. Drawing on Goffman's theory of impression management, we found that participants invested significant effort into controlling both the context of interactions and others' expectations, in order to mitigate the potential negative social consequences of disruptions. In performing this work, seniors were selective about what information they revealed to others about their chronic pain and availability. Given such efforts, seniors with chronic pain have unique needs for technologies to support their social interactions. © 2012 ACM.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9045691199
209,Lesbians over 60 speak for themselves.,"With all its faults, this study, begun in 1983, is the first attempt to reach a nationwide representation of lesbian elders in order to gather information about their background, their relationship with their families of origin, and, for those married to men, with their husbands, children, and grandchildren. It explores their sexual behavior, both their physical and psychological health, and how aging has affected them. With the relatively meagre data available, it tries to make some comparison between lesbians and gay men over 60. All of this is just a beginning, an effort, it is hoped, that will encourage researchers to investigate further this hidden population that is another fascinating component of our diverse society. Through our research, we established that gay women of advanced age, as we have long surmised, are everywhere. Like their younger cohorts, they live in all regions of America, rural as well as urban. They come in all colors and are from all occupations: professional, business, clerical, trades, domestic work, and land management, to name a few. Many of them are now retired. Their formal education ranges from high school diplomas to doctorate degrees. A few are financially well off, while another few live below the poverty line. The rest enjoy reasonable comfort in their own homes, on modest incomes. In both political and religious affiliation, they tend to be liberal. Their sexual history runs the gamut from exclusively homosexual, through equally homosexual and heterosexual, to asexual. As they age and sex becomes a less significant part of their relationships, companionship grows more important. They prefer to associate with other lesbians within 10 years of their own age, whom they meet in community social groups, through friends, or at work--but not in bars. They do not relish the thought of ending their lives in any institution for the aged, but would consider a gay/lesbian intergenerational retirement community acceptable. Their most serious problems, even with the advantaged group surveyed, are those that affect many women of advanced age in our society: loneliness and economic worries. Although the feminization of poverty has been a topic under public scrutiny for some time, because it involves women of all ages, less attention has been paid to it in relation to the elderly. The equally disabling condition brought on by their isolation and loneliness has also been disregarded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5436146526

It is forecast that in 2050 the number of people over the age of 60 will reach two billion. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) could have a significant impact on the quality of life of the older population, helping to make them more active while decreasing their marginalization and social isolation. Although there are significant differences in use of the Internet and its applications by older adults compared to the rest of the population, it must be borne in mind that this segment is not a homogenous group.

105,Social functioning of elderly persons with malignant diseases [Socijalno funkcionisanje starijih osoba obolelih od malignih bolesti],"Background/Aim. Malignant disease, its treatment and consequences of treatment can often lead to social marginalization and reduced quality of life. The aim of this research was to determine how elderly patients with malignant diseases function in their social environment. Methods. Sociodemographic questionnaire and interview were used to investigate a group of 49 elderly persons undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy treatment against early carcinomas (P1), and a group of 51 elderly persons with advanced stages of cancer undergoing systemic chemotherapy (P2). There were two cycles of assessment: one just before the beginning of the first cycle of adjuvant or systemic chemotherapy, and the other three months later. The research paradigm was based on the relation between individual treatment and the impact of the malignant disease on functional and social incompetence. The obtained findings were compared with the group of 50 healthy elderly people (K) who share the same relevant features but do not suffer from malignant diseases. Results. It was found that most healthy older people live in share house, whereas those who suffer from malignant diseases mostly live in separate households. In both groups of patients and healthy group older people are mostly taken care of by their children. Individuals in both groups of patients have been frequently visited by their relatives during initial stages of treatment, unlike the elderly people in the control group. However, the difference did not reach a statistical significance. Three months after the beginning of chemotherapy, there was a statistically relevant difference in favor of the group undergoing adjuvant treatment. Home visits eventually become less frequent, whereas communication by telephone becomes more frequent. It was also found that visits by friends and neighbors are statistically more frequent among subjects who undergo adjuvant treatment, both before the treatment began and three months later when compared to other groups. Conclusion. Our research shows that elderly people are subject to social exclusion, especially those with malignant diseases. Special care should be dedicated to monitoring of social functioning during treatment of patients with malignant disease considering the detected trend of deterioration and significance for further recover and cure. © 2015, Vojnosanit Pregl.

152,Loneliness and Ethnic Minority Elders in Great Britain: An Exploratory Study,"Loneliness, which describes the deficit between an individuals' expectation of the quality and/or quantity of social relationships and the actuality, is associated with poor quality of life, negative health outcomes and, in some cases, increased use of statutory services. Within Great Britain few studies have examined the prevalence of loneliness amongst older people from ethnic minorities. In this exploratory study we consider the prevalence of loneliness amongst older people, those aged 65 years and over, from the key minority groups growing old in Britain (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, African Caribbean, and Chinese) and draw explicit comparisons for these groups with the prevalence of loneliness reported for the general population and with older people in their countries of origin. We use two data sources: the Ethnicity and Loneliness Survey, a study of 300 minority elders aged 65+ living in the community, provides our prevalence estimates and secondary analysis of a study of 169 South Asian elders (aged 65+) undertaken in Birmingham to validate our prevalence rates for the Indian and Bangladeshi populations. We identified very high rates of reported loneliness, ranging from 24% to 50% amongst for those elders originating from China, Africa, the Caribbean, Pakistan and Bangladesh whilst those from India approximated to the norms of 8-10% for Britain. These results suggest that it is feasible to research loneliness amongst minority communities in Britain; that the levels of loneliness are, with the exception of the Indian population, very much higher than for the general population but are broadly comparable with rates of loneliness reported for older people in their countries of origin. There is a rich research agenda to be developed in extending our understanding of loneliness in later life amongst the increasingly culturally and ethnically diverse older population of Great Britain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3073088371
190,Predictors and subjective causes of loneliness in an aged population,"The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence and self-reported causes of loneliness among Finnish older population. The data were collected with a postal questionnaire from a random sample of 6786 elderly people (≥75 years of age). The response rate was 71.8% from community-dwelling sample. Of the respondents, 39% suffered from loneliness, 5% often or always. Loneliness was more common among rural elderly people than those living in cities. It was associated with advancing age, living alone or in a residential home, widowhood, low level of education and poor income. In addition, poor health status, poor functional status, poor vision and loss of hearing increased the prevalence of loneliness. The most common subjective causes for loneliness were illnesses, death of a spouse and lack of friends. Loneliness seems to derive from societal life changes as well as from natural life events and hardships originating from aging. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

168,"Quality of life in community-dwelling older people in Ireland: Association with ageing perceptions, physical health and psychological well-being","Quality of life (QoL) is a key outcome variable in determining the success of health and social policy. Often, QoL is assessed in a context where health or well-being are compromised. This study sought to explore individually defined QoL among older people living in the community in Ireland and to examine its determinants, including health and psychological well-being, and perceptions of ageing. A national randomly selected sample of community-dwelling older people (aged 65+) in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (N = 1,815) were interviewed in their homes. QoL, health and social status, and perceptions of ageing were assessed. The mean QoL score was high (78.5, SD = 18.1). Higher QoL was associated with higher social class, better self-assessed health, fewer functional impairments and lower levels of depression and loneliness (all p < .001). Higher QoL was also associated with more positive perceptions of ageing. While QoL for this older population was high, it was significantly negatively affected by lower socio-economic status and negative perceptions of ageing. © 2010 by The Psychological Society of Ireland.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.9026834225
255,"What about us, seniors? What difficulties do we face using Information and Communication Technology?","In a society marked by rapid demographic ageing and constant technological advances, investing in studies that promote communication and lessen social isolation is justified. This study aims to present the main difficulties seniors face using Information and Communications Technology (ICT), particularly computers; writing and formatting text, accessing the Internet to browse and do research; and using asynchronous and synchronous communication services like email and instant messaging. For conducting this study, partnerships were established with four Private Institutions for Social Solidarity in the municipality of Aveiro, within the scope of the SEDUCE project. The tools used for data collection were two questionnaire surveys and a field journal. The study included the participation of 22 seniors who used ICTs twice a week, in a total of 80 sessions of 90 minutes each. The results suggest that, although seniors experience countless and various difficulties, they are motivated, interested and determined to make the effort of integrating this activity into their daily life. © 2015 IEEE.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.2263879868
131,Original research: Loneliness and quality of life in chronically ILL rural older adults,"Background: Loneliness is a contributing factor to various health problems in older adults, including complex chronic illness, functional decline, and increased risk of mortality. OBJECTIVES: A pilot study was conducted to learn more about the prevalence of loneliness in rural older adults with chronic illness and how it affects their quality of life. The purposes of the data analysis reported here were twofold: to describe loneliness, chronic illness diagnoses, chronic illness control measures, prescription medication use, and quality of life in a sample of rural older adults; and to examine the relationships among these elements. Methods: A convenience sample of 60 chronically ill older adults who were community dwelling and living in Appalachia was assessed during face-to-face interviews for loneliness and quality of life, using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (version 3) and the CASP-12 quality of life scale. Chronic illness diagnoses, chronic illness control measures, and medication use data were collected through review of participants' electronic medical records. Results: Overall mean loneliness scores indicated significant loneliness. Participants with a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression had the highest mean loneliness scores, followed by those with lung disease and those with heart disease. Furthermore, participants with mood disorders, lung disease, or heart disease had significantly higher loneliness scores than those without these conditions. Loneliness was significantly related to total number of chronic illnesses and use of benzodiazepines. Use of benzodiazepines, diuretics, nitrates, and bronchodilators were each associated with a lower quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses should assess for loneliness as part of their comprehensive assessment of patients with chronic illness. Further research is needed to design and test interventions for loneliness.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.005539913763
130,Multidimensional structure of the Groningen Frailty Indicator in community-dwelling older people,"Background: Due to the rapidly increasing number of older people worldwide, the prevalence of frailty among older adults is expected to escalate in coming decades. It is crucial to recognize early onset symptoms to initiate specific preventive care. Therefore, early detection of frailty with appropriate screening instruments is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying dimensionality of the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), a widely used self-report screening instrument for identifying frail older adults. In addition, criterion validity of GFI subscales was examined and composition of GFI scores was evaluated. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the structural validity, internal consistency and criterion validity of the GFI questionnaire in older adults aged 65 years and older. All subjects completed the GFI questionnaire (n = 1508). To assess criterion validity, a smaller sample of 119 older adults completed additional questionnaires: De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, RAND-36 physical functioning, and perceived general health item of the EuroQol-5D. Exploratory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis were used to evaluate the structural validity of the GFI. A Venn diagram was constructed to show the composition of GFI subscale scores for frail subjects. Results: The factor structure of the GFI supported a three-dimensional structure of the scale. The subscales Daily Activities and Psychosocial Functioning showed good internal consistency, scalability, and criterion validity (Daily Activities: Cronbach's α = 0.81, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.84, r = -.62; Psychosocial Functioning: Cronbach's α = 0.80, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.35, r = -.48). The subscale Health Problems showed less strong internal consistency but acceptable scalability and criterion validity (Cronbach's α =.57, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.35, r = -.48). The present data suggest that 90% of the frail older adults experience problems in the Psychosocial Functioning domain. Conclusions: The present findings support a three-dimensional factor structure of the GFI, suggesting that a multidimensional assessment of frailty with the GFI is possible. These GFI subscale scores produce a richer assessment of frailty than with a single overall sum GFI score, and likely their use will contribute to more directed and customized care for older adults. © 2013 Bielderman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.196171465
58,AGNES: Connecting people in a multimodal way,"Western societies are confronted with a number of challenges caused by the increasing number of older citizens. One important aspect is the need and wish of older people to live as long as possible in their own home and maintain an independent life. As people grew older, their social networks disperse, with friends and families moving to other parts of town, other cities or even countries. Additionally, people become less mobile with age, leading to less active participation in societal life. Combined, this normal, age-related development leads to increased loneliness and social isolation of older people, with negative effects on mental and physical health of those people. In the AGNES project, a home-based system has been developed that allows connecting elderly with their families, friends and other significant people over the Internet. As most older people have limited experience with computers and often special requirements on technology, one focus of AGNES was to develop with the users novel technological means for interacting with their social network. The resulting system uses ambient displays, tangible interfaces and wearable devices providing ubiquitous options for interaction with the network, and secondary sensors for additionally generating carefully chosen information on the person to be relayed to significant persons. Evaluations show that the chosen modalities for interaction are well adopted by the users. Further it was found that use of the AGNES system had positive effects on the mental state of the users, compared to the control group without the technology. © 2013 OpenInterface Association.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.02731336227
118,Asset based community development-enriching the lives of older citizens,"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how asset-based community development (ABCD) can be used to build inclusive, connected communities that intentionally value the contribution of older citizens.Design/methodology/approach-ABCD was used as an approach to enable older people to transform their neighbourhood and make them a better place to live for all ages. The paper describes this approach and goes on to illustrate how it has been applied in three neighbourhoods using case studies.Findings-The case studies show that by using ABCD, connections can be made between people, associations/clubs, businesses and services, to achieve the aspirations the citizens have for their neighbourhood. The contribution of older citizens to community life is valued and the risk of isolation and loneliness reduced.Originality/value-The three case studies presented in this paper are unique in that they have applied ABCD with older people taking on the role of community builders and connectors. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2850127455
221,Environmental influences on the older person,"One must consider the relationship between the environment and the four basic psychosocial needs of man: order, identity, social connectedness and effectiveness. 1. Order. In order to function and to orient, a person must put an environment into some context of experience. Older people's cautiousness is partly a consequence of their decreasing sensory capability and of their reliance on less skillful ways of processing information about the situation. 2. Identity. The person needs to know how he fits into a situation, and what makes him different or unique. 3. Social connectedness. There is need for control over the intensity and quality of social contact with other individuals. 4. Effectiveness refers to the individual's need to have impact on his environment, to manipulate the environment and to have some sense of control. Privacy, like territory, has four main facets; basically, all refer to the individual's ability to control the quality and quantity of his social interaction. To a large extent, privacy and territoriality cut across the psychosocial needs of order, identity, social connectedness and effectiveness. The fourth facet is the condition of reserve. This is a psychologic privacy necessitated when the physical surroundings do not permit the other levels of privacy. The environment is a complex phenomenon made up of the individual, the physical setting, the rules and regulations governing that setting and the people in it, and the interpersonal and suprapersonal social constants. One must also be aware of the psychosocial needs of the individual for order, identity, social connectedness and effectiveness.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7189200322
364,Psychotic states arising in late life (late paraphrenia) the role of risk factors,"Background. This study explored the association between 'late paraphrenia' and various risk factors such as female gender, sensory impairment, marital status, positive family history of psychoses, and the presence of abnormal neurological signs. It was hypothesised that patients would show significantly more abnormal neurological signs than controls. Method. Inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of late paraphrenia were fulfilled by 47 patients, including in-patients, out-patients, day-patients, and those living in the community. Thirty-three age-, sex-, education-, and premorbid IQ-matched elderly controls were recruited from luncheon clubs in Southwark and Lambeth (London, UK). A scale for the assessment of neurological soft and hard signs was developed for this study. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and the Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale (TDRS) were also used. Results. There was a high female-to-male ratio (42:5), and a fourfold increase in the risk of patients having hearing impairment (odds ratio=4.15, CI(odds) = 1.36 to 12.63). There was no difference between the two groups in visual difficulties nor in marital status. Patients were approximately ten times more likely to be living on their own (odds ratio = 10.61; CI(odds) = 3.59 to 31.33) and 16 times more likely to be considered socially isolated (odds ratio = 16.65; CI(odd);= 5.39 to 51.40). There was no difference between patients and controls in frequency of schizophrenia-like family history. Patients were more likely than controls to exhibit neurological soft signs (z=4.70; P<0.001; CI(d)=4.61 to 9.63). The presence of abnormal involuntary and tardive dyskinesia movements was associated with the use of antipsychotic medication. Conclusion. Women appear to run a greater risk of developing late paraphrenia, especially those who are socially isolated and present with associated hearing impairment. The increased presence of neurological soft signs among patients indicates that brain disease may be a critical factor in the development of psychotic symptoms in late life.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.331127002
368,Doomed status: Observations on the segregation of impaired old people,"The antecedents and consequences of the segregation of severely impaired old people within institutions is a problem that deserves more research attention than it has so far received. Given that such segregation exists and that it has some positive benefits for both staff and residents in homes for the aged, it is proposed that there exist among administration and ward staff impulses to avoid the mentally impaired aged, and that these impulses are part of a more general phylogenetic residue. Many animals show avoidance reactions in the presence of strange objects or strange conspecific individuals, and the more advanced the animal, the more disturbed he seems to be. It is suggested that the segregation of impaired old people consigns them to a doomed role, rather than a sick role, and that the process operates largely through the impact of the activation of the emergency team and the withdrawal of community support and can result in the death of the individual, partly by means of suggestion. Examples of sudden unexplained deaths are drawn from material on simpler societies. © 1979 Human Sciences Press.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.377670066
102,Chronic illness and loneliness in older adulthood: The role of self-protective control strategies,"This study examined whether levels of chronic illness predict enhanced feelings of loneliness in older adulthood. In addition, it investigated whether engagement in health-related self-protection (e.g., positive reappraisals), but not in health engagement control strategies (e.g., investment of time and effort), would buffer the adverse effect of chronic illness on older adults' feelings of loneliness. Method: Loneliness was examined repeatedly in 2-year intervals over 8 years in a longitudinal study of 121 community-dwelling older adults (Time 1 age = 64 to 83 years). In addition, levels of chronic illness, health-related control strategies, and sociodemographic variables were assessed at baseline. Results: Growth-curve models showed that loneliness linearly increased over time and that this effect was observed only among participants who reported high, but not low, baseline levels of chronic illness. In addition, health-related self-protection, but not health engagement control strategies, buffered the adverse effect of chronic illness on increases in loneliness. Conclusions: Loneliness increases in older adulthood as a function of chronic illness. Older adults who engage in self-protective strategies to cope with their health threats might be protected from experiencing this adverse effect. © 2014 American Psychological Association.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2570404045
126,Suffering caused by care-elderly patients' experiences in community care,"Background: Growing old involves many changes in life and implies an increased risks of illness and different forms of disabilities. Life may change in a radical way when a person gets a disease like dementia or moves to a nursing home due to disabilities or needs. In both cases, it often leads to an increased dependency on care where the patient becomes exposed and vulnerable and thereby at a higher risk for experiencing different forms of suffering. Aim: The aim of this study was to elucidate and gain a deeper understanding of elderly patients' experiences of suffering in relation to community care in nursing homes and home care services. Materials and methods: A lifeworld hermeneutical approach was used. Phenomenological interviews and conversations with an open approach were conducted and analysed with a focus on meanings. Findings: The findings were presented in four main themes; an absence of the other in care, an absence of dialogues, a sense of alienation and a sense of insecurity. The findings in this study revealed that persons who were cared for in nursing homes and home care services sometimes were exposed to an unnecessary suffering. The suffering sometimes was caused by various caring actions, that is, unnecessary suffering. The suffering caused by care that aroused was due to caregiver's inability to be present, to show their face, and truly meet the patient. Conclusion: Suffering from care increased the elderly patients' feelings of insecurity, loneliness, and alienation; this seemed to be the foundation for patients' experiences of being outside a human community. There was a lack of knowledge and understanding about the patient's lifeworld. © 2013 R. Svanström et al.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6209443014
11,A randomized controlled trial of the psychosocial impact of providing internet training and access to older adults,"The Internet (electronic mail and the World Wide Web) may provide new opportunities for communication that can help older adults avoid social isolation. This randomized controlled trial assessed the psychosocial impact of providing Internet access to older adults over a five-month period. One hundred volunteers from four congregate housing sites and two nursing facilities were randomly assigned to receive Internet training or to a wait list control group. The pre & post measures included the UCLA Loneliness scale, modified CES Depression scale, a measure of locus of control, computer attitudes, number of confidants, and overall quality of life. Participants received nine hours of small group training in six sessions over two weeks. Computers were available for continued use over five months and the trainer was available two hours/week for questions. At the end of the trial, 60% of the intervention group continued to use the Internet on a weekly basis. Although there was a trend toward decreased loneliness and depression in intervention subjects compared to controls, there were no statistically significant changes from baseline to the end of trial between groups. Among Internet users (n = 29) in the intervention group there were trends toward less loneliness, less depression, more positive attitudes toward computers, and more confidants than among intervention recipients who were not regular users (n = 19) of this technology. Most elderly participants in this trial learned to use the Internet and the majority continued to use it on a weekly basis. The psychosocial impact of Internet use in this sample suggested trends in a positive direction. Further research is needed to determine more precisely, which older adults, residing in which environmental contexts are more likely than others to benefit from this rapidly expanding information and communication link.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.1899216942
38,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",0,1,no remote,1,,,,,0.575651844

This paper addresses the question of whether and how playing Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) help older adults. We analyzed the relationships of older adults' social interactions in Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) to three social-psychological factors (i.e., loneliness, depression and social support). A total of 176 web surveys were usable from the 222 respondents aged 55 years or more who played World of Warcraft and were recruited online to complete the survey. It was found that enjoyment of relationships and quality of guild play had strong impacts on older adults' social and emotional wellbeing. Specifically, higher enjoyment of relationships was related to higher social support as well as lower levels of loneliness. Higher quality of guild play was related to higher levels of social support and lower levels of loneliness and depression.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.4811716817
373,Work and age,"In modern industrial communities a mismatch has arisen between the process of ageing and the pattern of working life. Over the last 100 years there has been a crystallization of the life-pattern into three phases, education (up to ages 15-25), work (from 15/25-65) and retirement (after 65), with sharp divisions between the phases. This pattern no longer conforms to human needs. Education needs to continue throughout life. The psychological changes that take place during adult life make it inappropriate to regard the period of working life as a homogeneous phase. Sudden retirement finally confronts the individual with difficult problems of adjustment. A restructuring of the life cycle, designed to meet human needs, and to bring education, work and leisure into a common pattern, is proposed. © 1972 Oxford University Press.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1837763855
162,"Impoverished environment, cognition, aging and dementia","Animals living in an impoverished environment, i.e., without the possibility of physical and social activity, perform worse on cognitive tests compared to animals in an enriched environment. The same cognitive difference is also observed in humans. However, it is not clear whether this difference is caused by a decrease in cognition due to an impoverished environment or an increase due to an enriched environment. This review discusses the impact of an impoverished environment on cognition in animal experimental studies and human experimental studies with community-dwelling and institutionalized older people. Results show that the cognitive functioning of old rats is more affected by an impoverished environment than young rats. Similarly, sedentary and lonely people (impoverished environment) have worse cognitive functioning and show a faster cognitive decline than physically and socially active people. Institutionalization further aggravates cognitive decline, probably due to the impoverished environment of nursing homes. In institutions, residents spend an unnecessary and excessive amount of time in bed; out of bed they show mainly sedentary or completely passive behavior. In conclusion, older people, especially those that have been institutionalized, have poor levels of physical and social activity, which in turn has a negative impact on cognitive functioning. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2011.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.4463157153
188,"Personal factors, communication and vision predict social participation in older adults","Social isolation is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in older people. Speech pathologists often consider that communication disabilities associated with normal ageing (sensory loss, language and discourse changes) contribute to social isolation. The aims of this study were to describe the functioning of older people using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO, 2001) as a conceptual framework for language and sensory functioning, communicative activity, and social participation, and to explore the relationship between communication (both at an impairment level and an activity level), social participation and personal factors (demographics and emotional health). In a prospective study, 47 women and 28 men aged 62 to 98 years (mean = 74 yrs) completed objective and subjective assessments of functioning and participation, and provided personal information. Assessments were individually conducted in a face-to-face interview situation with the primary researcher, who was a speech pathologist. Assessments revealed the sample had predominantly mild hearing and vision impairments, unimpaired naming ability, frequent involvement in a wide range of communication activities, and variable social network size and social activities participation. Social participation was shown to be associated with vision, communication activities, age, education and emotional health. Naming and hearing impairments were not reliable predictors of social participation. It was concluded that professionals interested in maintaining and improving social participation of older people could well consider these predictors in community-directed interventions. Speech pathologists should therefore promote older people's involvement in everyday communicative activities while also limiting the impact of communication-related impairments, so that social participation is maintained in our ageing population. © 2005 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.209363399
21,Sympathetic devices: Communication technologies for inclusion,"Encouraging wellness at home is a necessary step in alleviating the burden of an increasing number of older adults on the health care system and can also provide a vehicle for promoting independence and quality of life among older adults. However, aging at home comes with its own challenges, one of which is depression caused by isolation, a serious condition related to healthy aging and outcomes affecting a large number of older adults. Addressing communication needs across housing options might bring us closer to understanding and preventing social isolation and loneliness among older adults. This article presents an iterative process of applied within-subjects survey and action research studies for designing communication technologies sympathetic devices for older adults living independently. Emphasis and discussion is given to describing the design process of the sympathetic devices. Several concepts and products were designed and tested with older adults with consideration for aesthetic preferences as well as usefulness, ease of use, and accessibility of the technological devices. The results provide strong evidence of the importance of both form and function, when designing such technological devices for acceptance and adoption by older adults. More importantly, the research highlights a need for a multidisciplinary and intergenerational approach to address the real needs of older adults in the design of such technologies. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",0,0,"no intervention, no remote, no SI",0,,,,,0.2887654384
224,"Approach, avoidance, and contact behavior of individually recognized animals automatically quantified with an imaging technique","A low-cost system was developed that allows the assessment of the location and the direction of movements of two individually recognized animals in a social interaction. The program was validated by (i) assessing deliberately induced approach and avoidance movements of artificial objects, (ii) the effects of known differences in social behavior between differently treated rats, and (iii) repeatedly testing social behavior under similar circumstances to assess enhanced social contact due to being familiar with the arena. Movements toward and away from each other of individually housed versus group-housed animals, and of young versus aged animals, were analyzed by the system. The results obtained, demonstrated that in the case of randomly moving artificial objects specific approachers or avoiders could not be identified, whereas isolated and young rats showed more approach behavior than their respective controls. In addition, the algorithm applied for calculating relative approach and avoidance movements elucidated differences between groups that were not noticed by human observers. Social contact behavior of rats was assessed automatically. Habituation to the testing situation in repeated testing increased social contact behavior. © 1992.",0,0,not OA,1,,,,,0.8505111642
106,Loneliness and Belongingness in Older Lesbians: The Role of Social Groups as “Community”,"This article explores loneliness and isolation in older lesbians, looking at the benefits offered by an over-55 fortnightly social group in Yorkshire. I argue that the women interviewed were more vulnerable to loneliness than their heterosexual counterparts as a direct consequence of many years of privacy and self-concealment and because they were more likely to be single, childless, and have fractured relationships with birth families; all significant losses viewed by the women as the “price you paid” for being a lesbian. Although the group did not completely alleviate loneliness, it provided a place of safety and offered a sanctuary where participants could be themselves and where friendships and other groups were formed. For many women, the group's exclusivity to older lesbians and bisexual women was deeply significant and influenced their decision to attend. I suggest that such groups have a vital role to play in promoting older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender well-being and offering protection against loneliness and isolation in older age. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7022694242
99,Promoting social capital to alleviate loneliness and improve health among older people in Spain,"Loneliness is especially frequent among older people in Southern Europe. Furthermore, promoting social capital to tackle loneliness and its health effects is an understudied intervention strategy. Therefore, a complex intervention was piloted in Spain in a pre-post study with a 2-year follow-up. Its aims were to explore the feasibility of the intervention and its short- and long-term effects. It was conducted in one mixed rural-urban and two urban areas of diverse socioeconomic levels from 2011 to 2012. The intervention framework was based on social capital theory applying a behaviour change model and care co-ordination. The intervention comprised: (i) a co-ordinated action aimed at building a network between primary healthcare centres and community assets in the neighbourhood and (ii) a group-based programme, which promoted social capital among lonely older people, especially social support and participation. Older people active in senior centres volunteered as gatekeepers. The main outcome domain was loneliness. Secondary outcome domains were participation, social support, self-perceived health, quality of life, depressive symptoms and use of health resources. Pre-post changes were assessed with t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test. Differences between the three time points were assessed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Social workers and nurses were successfully involved as group leaders, 10 volunteers took part and 38 participants were included. After the intervention, loneliness decreased while social participation and support significantly increased. Furthermore, the number of visits to nurses increased. Exactly 65.8% of the participants built social contacts within the group and 47.4% became engaged in new activities. Two years later, social effects were maintained and depressive symptoms had decreased. Exactly 44.7% of the participants continued to be in contact with at least one person from the group and 39.5% continued participating. The intervention contributes a novel and feasible social capital-based approach for alleviating loneliness among older adults while prompting meaningful changes in their lives. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.1513444551
325,A revisit on older adults suicides and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong,"Background: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 had an enormous impact on Hong Kong society and the suicide rate was also at its historical high, 18.6 per 100,000. The most significant increase was found among the older adults aged 65 or above. Methods: Poisson Regression Models were used to examine impact of the SARS epidemic on older adults suicides in Hong Kong. A complete set of the suicide statistics for the period 1993-2004 from the Coroners' Court were made available for the analysis. Chi-square test was used to compare the profile of the older adult suicide cases in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. Results: It showed an excess of older adults suicides in April 2003, when compared to the month of April of the other years. A trough, instead of the usual summer peak, was observed in June, suggesting some of the older adults suicides might have been brought forward. On a year basis, the annual older adult's suicide rates in 2003 and 2004 were significantly higher than that in 2002, suggesting the suicide rate did not return to the level before the SARS epidemic. Based on the Coroners' suicide death records, overall severity of illness, level of dependency and worrying of having sickness among the older adult suicides were found to be significantly different in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. Conclusion: The SARS epidemic was associated with an increase in older adults' suicide rate in April 2003 and some suicide deaths in June 2003 might have been brought forward. Moreover, an increase in the annual older adults' suicide rate in 2003 was observed and the rate in 2004 did not return to the level of 2002. Loneliness and disconnectedness among the older adults in the community were likely to be associated with the excess older adults' suicides in 2003. Maintaining and enhancing mental well being of the public over the period of epidemic is as important as curbing the spread of the epidemic. Attention and effort should also be made to enhance the community's ability to manage fear and anxiety, especially in vulnerable groups over the period of epidemic to prevent tragic and unnecessary suicide deaths.

183,An exploration of loneliness: Communication and the social networks of older people with cerebral palsy,"Background: There is a large body of research focusing on the experiences of loneliness of older adults, yet little is known about the loneliness experiences of older adults with lifelong disability. In this paper, the authors present some findings from a larger qualitative study on the loneliness experiences of older people with cerebral palsy. Method: Seven older adults with cerebral palsy participated in in-depth interviews. Analysis of the interviews identified overarching themes and recurrent topics in the data. These topics were coded and then grouped under the overarching themes. Results: Six themes were identified. All participants agreed that the themes of communication and social networks are most important when considering loneliness. In this paper, the participants' discussion of these two themes and their related topics are presented. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the need to provide support and training in communication to older people with cerebral palsy who experience communication difficulty, as well as to their communication partners. They also indicate the need for policy development to assist older adults with cerebral palsy to develop and maintain their social networks and form relationships that are rewarding and enriching. © 2007 Australasian Society for the Study of Intellectual Disability Inc.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6042355861
223,Who discloses the most on Facebook,"With the development of new media, the issue of privacy and its determinants has become the subject of a large body of literature in recent years. The main objective of this study was to check whether loneliness is a predictor of putting private information on Facebook. The participants were 887 young people. Facebook Privacy Scale and Loneliness Scale were used. We showed that young age and loneliness are predictors of disclosure on Facebook. Moreover, junior high school students more often put private information on their Facebook profiles than senior high school and university students. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,not OA,1,,,,,0.2225614239
71,High level architecture of a user-friendly relational home computing interface for people with mild cognitive impairment,"Purpose: This paper describes the initial phases of work done on creating a home computing interface designed especially for older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Home computing has become a common part of contemporary daily life, arguably to the point where computer competency is a social expectation. Older adults may face numerous barriers to using computers, due to physical, cognitive, and social factors1. Home computing can be used to address many challenges experienced by older adults, such as social isolation. Some people with MCI may not have necessarily lost any of their cognitive abilities, but memory loss and other problems can impair successful independent living. Making computers easier to use for older adults is a way to bring helpful technology into their lives, as well as to help them participate more fully in the digital world. This project is being pursued as part of the AAL-WELL project that seeks to promote healthy and active ageing, with special attention given to people living with MCI. Methodology: The high-level architecture of this interface is based on a scoping review of the computing needs of people with MCI and includes technologies designed to facilitate ease-of-use by people with limited experience in using computers, along with relational agents designed to encourage and anticipate their interactions with applications. Technologies include motion recognition video cameras, such as those currently used in video game consoles, as well as speech recognition software. These avenues for input do not require the manipulation of a control device, and can be tailored to the unique characteristics of an individual, (such as compensating for tremors), providing greater accessibility. Another key technology is the concept of a relational agent; a relational agent is an animated computer character which seeks to build a relationship with the user over time2. Using a relational agent as the primary means of communicating with the user facilitates interaction that is based on the patterns of normal human interaction. This reduces the amount of technical skill that a user needs to learn how to use the system. It also enables the inclusion of functionality and activities that are aimed at caring for the emotional and physical well-being of the user, such as polling for user's current emotional state, chatting, and reminders (e.g., to pay bills, exercise, take medicine, see friends). This project will continue, as software is developed to complete a useful prototype. This is achieved using an iterative development methodology, which is crucial not only in a technical sense, where it supports flexible and measurable progress (as seen in Agile software development), but also as participatory action research, since it gives stakeholders multiple opportunities to test, inform, and guide the development of the project based on their own knowledge and prioritie Technology can be seen as an extension of its user, supplementing their inherent abilities. For people suffering from some forms of decline associated with ageing, computers provide a useful and cost-effective tool for improving their daily life. Computers are also a way of increasing social interaction by means of electronic communication, and providing pleasurable activity, such as listening to music. This project shows how advancing technology can be used in an innovative manner to address the gap between the availability of home computing functionality and its effective use in the daily lives of older adults.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.002982195175
44,Acceptability of a Teleoperated Android by Senior Citizens in Danish Society: A Case Study on the Application of an Embodied Communication Medium to Home Care,"We explore the potential of teleoperated androids, which are embodied telecommunication media with humanlike appearances. By conducting a pilot study, we investigated how Telenoid, a teleoperated android designed as a minimalistic human, affects people in the real world when it is employed to express telepresence and a sense of 'being there'. Our exploratory study focused on the social aspects of the android robot, which might facilitate communication between the elderly and Telenoid's operator. This new way of creating social relationships can be used to solve a problem in society, the social isolation of senior citizens. It has become a major issue even in Denmark that is known as one of countries with advanced welfare systems. In this pilot study at Danish homes, we found that the elderly with or without dementia showed positive attitudes toward Telenoid and developed various dialogue strategies. Contrary to the issue of revulsion that can be caused by humanlike robots and the negative reactions by non-users in media reports, we discuss potentials and challenges of the android's embodiment for social inclusion of senior citizens in telecommunications. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0,0,"no remote, no SI",1,,,,,0.8248551545
286,"Nutritional risk and body mass index predict hospitalization, nursing home admissions, and mortality in community-dwelling older adults: Results from the UAB study of aging with 8.5 years of follow-up","Background. Nutritional risk and low BMI are common among community-dwelling older adults, but it is unclear what associations these factors have with health services utilization and mortality over long-term follow-up. The aim of this study was to assess prospective associations of nutritional risk and BMI with all-cause, nonsurgical, and surgical hospitalization; nursing home admission; and mortality over 8.5 years. Methods. Data are from 1,000 participants in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging, a longitudinal, observational study of older black and white residents of Alabama aged 65 and older. Nutritional risk was assessed using questions associated with the DETERMINE checklist. BMI was categorized as underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), class I obese (30.0-34.9), and classes II and III obese (≥35.0). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess risk of all-cause, nonsurgical, and surgical hospitalization; nursing home admission; and mortality. Covariates included social support, social isolation, comorbidities, and demographic measures. Results. In adjusted models, persons with high nutritional risk had 51% greater risk of all-cause hospitalization (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.00) and 50% greater risk of nonsurgical hospitalizations (95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.01; referent: low nutritional risk). Persons with moderate nutritional risk had 54% greater risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.99). BMI was not associated with any outcomes in adjusted models. Conclusions. Nutritional risk was associated with all-cause hospitalizations, nonsurgical hospitalizations, and mortality. Nutritional risk may affect the disablement process that leads to health services utilization and death. These findings point to the need for more attention on nutritional assessment, interventions, and services for community-dwelling older adults. © The Author 2014.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2151681425
215,The effects of retirement,"Old age is not a disease; it is a reward for living a long time, and therefore retirement must be perceived by each individual as unprecedented opportunity and not redundancy. The elderly must be encouraged to raise their own expectations and even 'live dangerously'. For some people the first day of retirement and the advent of old age can be synonymous, due to a subconscious misapprehension that expulsion from the work force is an outcome of diminishing physical and/or mental performance. The most damaging repercussions of old age are isolation and loneliness, which are generally magnified by retirement. The way in which the individual faces up to retirement remains the most crucial factor, but we must not underestimate the damaging influence of community attitudes.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7490124924
35,Internet use and psychological wellness during late adulthood,"An aging population is best served by social, personal, and health support focused on maintaining and maximizing personal independence. The Internet affords numerous opportunities for individuals of all ages to communicate, access information, and engage in recreational activities. A community-based sample of 122 adults over 60 years of age completed a questionnaire which assessed three clusters of characteristics: (a) frequency and patterns of Internet use, (b) well-being (loneliness, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, and depression), and (c) demographics (age, income, education). Significant correlations emerged between the three clusters of measured variables. Controlling for demographic differences, Internet use and self-efficacy remained significantly related. Among the sample of older adults, individuals who used the Internet more had higher perceptions of self-efficacy than those who used the Internet rarely or not at all. © 2011 Canadian Association on Gerontology.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6890631563
77,Development of a socio-technical system for an age-appropriate domestic environment,"Being part of the social community is for many people a crucial part of their life. Unfortunately, many of the elder generation are not able to participate due to physical condition and lack of will power. These people often suffer from loneliness and depression. In order to overcome these issues a system is being developed with its main goal to be a motivator for these people. Closely related to this is the term of primary prevention. Within an AAL living room scenario an armchair with integrated sensors monitors several vital signs and offers the possibility to perform exercises which both are displayed on a TV screen. In addition, by using a tablet the user is able to communicate with medical experts as well as social group members, relatives and friends. The acquisition of vital data in combination with elements of (virtual) social networks prevents isolation, motivates to be (more) active and supports healthy aging with a high joie de vivre. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.8222669488
56,Go-myLife: A context-aware social networking platform adapted to the needs of elderly users,"In our increasingly dislocated and mobile society, online social network sites are proving valuable in bridging distances and facilitating interaction and communication. People are spending a significant amount of time at the top social networking websites in order to manage existing relationships with friends, reconnect with old friends, share media and find new contacts that have similar interests. Fulfilling these needs are just as important for elderly people as it is for everyone else, but can become more difficult. Many are no longer at work so they do not have a daily set of activities with the same group of people. This, combined with increasing frailty, can lead to a habit of staying at home, which adds to the feeling of loneliness and isolation. In spite of this need for social contact, elderly people, even those who use the internet, tend to miss out on the benefits of online social networking platforms. Elderly people are keen to maintain contact with the different generations of their family. Many older people have already invested significant time in building contact lists and relationships within the major social networks. Go-myLife has therefore not attempted to set up a new social network but rather a platform from where elderly people can post messages and receive updates and take part in discussions across a variety of platforms, thus bringing existing communities together. In this paper, the authors present a context-aware social networking platform, the ""Going online: my social life"" platform, which is adapted to the needs of elderly users. © 2013 ACM.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.1903215566
200,Combating loneliness: A friendship enrichment programme for older women,"Research indicates that friendship contributes to wellbeing in later life in various ways: Through the provision of companionship in daily life, support during stressful transitions, sustainment of identity under changing circumstances and adaptation to old age. However not all older people have friends available who fulfil these different functions. In order to promote wellbeing and reduce loneliness, an educational programme on friendship enrichment for older women has been developed and implemented in the Netherlands. The friendship programme's main goal is empowerment; it helps women clarify their needs in friendship, analyse their current social network, set goals in friendship and develop strategies to achieve goals. Reduction of loneliness, when present, is also an important goal of the programme. A study that followed 40 participants during the year after the programme demonstrates that a majority succeeded in developing new, or improving existing, friendships and in significantly reducing their loneliness. They also reported changes related to the self and social behaviour. Limitations of the research design, reflection on the feasibility of reducing loneliness through a single type of intervention, and possible applications of the programme's design to other areas, are presented in the discussion.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5391216651
277,"Reshaping what counts as care: Older people, work and new technologies","In governmental and technical discourses, telecare systems are described as a solution to the 'problem' of aging populations. This paper draws on an ongoing ethnography of the implementation of telecare in one county in England and asks how the promotion and implementation of telecare shapes understandings of what care means for frail older people living at home. We suggest that telecare discourses attempt to divide care work into three distinct domains of practice: monitoring, physical care and social-emotional care. Telecare, in this logic, deals only with monitoring and leaves the other elements untouched. This tripartite division of care, we argue, both diminishes the kinds of care (potentially) offered in telecare and fails to account for the complexities of all kinds of care (physical, social-emotional and telecare). Building on work from disability studies and feminist studies, we suggest that what counts as care needs to be rethought if telecare is to make a positive contribution to the lives of older people and those who care for and about them. © 2009 Association ALTER.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.1102105974
305,Health and social conditions of older people in Albania: Baseline data from a national survey,"The paper presents the data from a household survey in a representative sample of the population of individuals over 65 years old in three regions of Albania. The survey included a quantitative assessment of socioeconomic situation including poverty, social participation and social exclusion, as well as assessment of ill-health including limitations of daily living activities and chronic conditions. It was found that older people in urban areas are better covered with social security as compared to older residents in rural and informal areas. One third (32%) of participants reported not good or bad health and the majority (57%) of them were poor or very poor. Significant differences were found with individuals residing in informal areas around Tirana, reporting worse health conditions than elderly people living in urban areas. Approximately one fifth (18%) were totally or partially isolated from social networks. Prevalence of selected chronic conditions ranged from 9 percent to 58 percent. Almost the totality (93%) of the sample experienced some pain and 9 percent were bed-bound. More than one in four (27%) reported not receiving medical care when they needed it. Demographic trends mixed with a society in economic and political transition raise concerns about increasing needs for care and social inclusion of older people. Moreover, there is a low level of preparation of this society to cope with chronic diseases and long-term care.

192,Loneliness and depression in independent living retirement communities: Risk and resilience factors,"Socio-emotional selectivity theory posits that as individuals age, they desire less social stimulation and novelty, and tend to select close, reliable relationships to meet their emotional needs. Residence in congregate facilities affords social exposure, yet does not guarantee access to close relationships, so that loneliness may be a result. Further, the gerontology literature has suggested that loneliness in late life may be a risk factor for serious mental health concerns such as depression. This article examined data on loneliness and depressive symptoms from older adults aged 60-98, residing in two age-segregated independent living facilities. Overlap between those scoring in the depressed range on the Geriatric Depression Scale and those scoring more than one standard deviation above the mean on the UCLA Loneliness Scale was less than 50%, although zero-order correlation of the two continuous scores was moderately high. Potential risk and resilience factors were regressed on the continuous scores of the two scales in separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Depression was predicted by being older, number of chronic health conditions, grieving a recent loss, fewer neighbor visitors, less participation in organized social activities and less church attendance. Grieving a recent loss, receiving fewer visits from friends, and having a less extensive social network predicted loneliness. In addition, loneliness scores explained about 8% of the unique variance in depression scores, suggesting it is an independent risk factor for depressive symptoms. Loneliness scores were seen to be more widely dispersed in these respondents, with less variance explained by the available predictors. Suggestions are made for addressing loneliness in older adults as a means of preventing more serious mental health consequences.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5873966299
104,Faith and spirituality in older people-A Jewish perspective,"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to explore the role that faith and spirituality play for Jewish people as they age and examine how this is expressed and supported by a health and social care environment. Design/methodology/approach-This is a case study based on work at Jewish Care and supported by other Jewish networks. It also builds on qualitative research on Ageing Well carried out in 2012. Findings-As people age they have a need to connect with their community. Faith-based communities are ready made and often the first point of call for Jewish people. The way in which people express their faith or spirituality may not manifest itself in practice but be more about inclusion and connection. Life circumstances will determine people's faith, identity and approach to spirituality-e.g. Holocaust survivors. There is a feeling that religious affiliation and the way it is expressed has polarised in the community which means that older people often do not connect with current ways of expressing or connecting to their faith. Research limitations/implications-This is not a systematic research but examines through practice different approaches to supporting people as they age via a faith-based provision. Practical implications-The approach could be replicated by other faith-based providers but also the approach and lessons should be considered by more generalist providers so that they ensure they meet the needs of the individual receiving their services. The inclusion principle reminds the author that care in a vacuum will not support the emotional and psychological needs of people. Social implications-Divisions within a faith group opportunities for younger people to learn from their older peers reminder of more established values around faith. Originality/value-Identifying the way in which faith is often an expression and connection to community and can reduce social isolation.

The results of the investigation confirm that seniors were not prepared to deal with information and communication technologies, moreover, that many of them are not active in the technological society, creating feelings of loneliness, fear and ignorance. The aim of the study was to determine the changes in mood and mindset to incorporate older adults today’s technological society through a process of learning of ICT.

269,Gestures as interface for a home TV digital divide solutions through inertial sensors,"Seniors are the fastest growing segment of populations not only in many parts of Europe, but also in Japan and the United States. ICT technologies are not very popular among many elderly and also are not designed around their cultural necessities and ergonomic needs. The risk is that in the very near future this growing segment will be digitally isolated, in a society that is more and more based on ICT as infrastructure for service, and communications. Easy Reach Project proposes an ergonomic application to break social isolation through social interaction to help the elderly to overcome barrier of the digital divide. This paper focuses its attention on the development of the technology and algorithms used as Human Computer Interface of the Easy Reach Project, that exploits inertial sensors to detect gestures. Many experimental algorithms for gesture recognition have been developed using inertial sensors in conjunction with other sensors or devices, or by themselves, but they have not been thoroughly tested in real situations, they are not devoted to adapt to the elderly and their way of executing gestures. The elderly are not used to modern interfaces and devices, and - due to aging - they can face problems in executing even very simple gestures. Our algorithm based on Pearson index and Hamming distance for gestures recognition has been tested both with young and elderly, and was shown to be resilient to changes in velocity and individual differences, still maintaining great accuracy of recognition (97.4% in user independent mode; 98.79% in user dependent mode). The algorithm has been adopted by the Easy Reach consortium (2009-2013) to pilot the human machine gesture-based interface. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.2574853702

The system has been designed to enhance communication among both friends and strangers and has been developed as a possible tool to increase interaction in older adults suffering from social isolation and loneliness. The paper uses remote logging data to inform discussion of how such a technology was received and utilised over time in a home setting. Qualitative data gathered via entry and exit interviews, and weekly checkpoint calls were used to provide deeper insight into patterns and practices identified via the logs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.5823876508
366,Frailty and friendship,"Ill health is an ever present possibility in the lives of apparently fit and active elderly people. Together, members of the elderly peer group establish norms of sickness behaviour and monitor each other's performance in terms of collective standards. Various responses occur when a friend is no longer able to engage in the activities of friendship. They range from the withdrawal of one or both partners to the bestowal of friendship on the frail as a gift. The paper draws on material collected during research on old people's friendships and formal organisations in the south of England. It examines the contrast between the policy makers' view that friends have a role in the promotion of health with that of gerontologists for whom friendship and long term ill health are incompatible. The evidence offered here challenges conventional thinking about friendship and health. It suggests that the importance of equity is exaggerated in the literature. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4877652926
229,Caregiving for people with dementia in a rural context in South Africa,"Background: This research is an exploratory pilot study into the phenomenon of caregiving for people with dementia in a rural context in South Africa. Method: This study used a qualitative method of inquiry for conducting individual interviews with five caregivers to collect the data. The interviews were conducted in the local language of isiZulu. All interviews were audiotaped, and then transcribed into English. Transcriptions were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: There were three main emergent themes, namely views and responsibilities of the caregiver, impact of caregiving, and skills and services to assist the caregiver. There were numerous subsidiary themes such as acceptance of the ageing process, a sense of duty and kinship in African culture, and dealing with problem behaviours. Caregiving was also viewed as a character-building experience, and has major implications such as promoting social isolation, restricting activities of daily living, reducing employment and increasing financial burden. Services that would alleviate caregiver burden are education, caregiver training, a financial grant and respite care. Conclusions: Although these findings are not generalisable, it would appear that caregivers of people with dementia suffer significant psychosocial distress, and would benefit from emotional and financial support. It remains to be seen who will provide this support, but policy-makers as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations will have to factor this into their forward planning to render an effective service for people with dementia and their families. Advocacy groups should also disseminate information on dementia and caregiving responsibility, whilst healthcare professionals should screen for caregiver stress or caregiver burden in individuals caring for people with dementia. © 2015 The Author(s).",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.3743947451
251,Convergence of Untutored Song in Group-Reared Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata),"Zebra finches develop abnormal song if they cannot interact with adult song tutors during the 1st few months after hatching. The authors investigated whether untutored juveniles would learn song from each other. The birds were isolated from adult males at 10 days of age and their songs recorded after Day 80. By the authors' measures of syllable sharing and the judgments of human listeners, the songs of untutored brothers were as similar to each other as those of birds reared together with a tutor. The songs of group untutored birds were, however, more variable, and they contained abnormal elements, as did the songs of birds reared apart from all other males. The fact that untutored brothers copied song from each other raises the possibility that juveniles might influence each other's song development, even when adult tutors are present. If this were the case, it would increase the range of social interactions that determine which songs juveniles learn. © 1995 American Psychological Association.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.07785347216

Methods: Path analysis was performed on data of 1,205 community-living older women aged 55 and above with psychological well-being assessed by depressive symptoms (15-items Geriatric Depression Scale) and SF-12 MCS (mental component summary scale of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey) quality of life scores assessed at baseline and follow-up 1.5 years later. Results: Goodness-of-fit indices used for the model showed good fits. All of the path coefficients were meaningful in absolute magnitude and significant at P<0.001. Living alone was associated concurrently with lack of a confidant (r = 0.11), both of which predicts loneliness (path coefficient = 0.09). Loneliness predicts more depressive symptoms (path coefficient = 0.25) and SF-12 MCS (path coefficient =-0.28) at baseline, as well as at follow-up. Conclusion: The findings suggest that loneliness mediates the relationship between living alone, lack of a confidant, and psychological well-being. Living alone becomes detrimental when it leads to loneliness. Social programs directed at elderly women who are living alone should alleviate loneliness through satisfactory interpersonal relationships, and emotional and spiritual support. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5284105145
101,From positive ageing to positive living; A changing perspective from the Beth Johnson Foundation,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the learning from the positive ageing and positive living projects of the Beth Johnson Foundation (BJF) and to contribute to the discourse around ageing and older people. Design/methodology/approach - The content for this case study was drawn from evidence gathering activities with different generations of older people, with key stakeholders, commissioners and policy makers. This was supported by extensive desk top analysis of information and research on the subjects of positive and active ageing. Findings - This case study examines the key elements of positive ageing within a life course context and explores the language and culture around ageing. It makes some recommendations, based on practice, that support a change in the dialogue around ageing from positive ageing to positive living. Practical implications - This approach is of interest to all citizens, to those who work with older people, to commissioners and to decision makers. It promotes a multi-generational approach to the co-design of services. It supports prevention, health promotion and appropriate interventions which are not based on age. It also, therefore, promotes ageing as a ""natural"" part of the life course, challenges negative stereotypes around ageing and ensures accessible, inclusive and quality services. Social implications - The content and conclusions of the case study challenge some of the traditional thinking and approaches around ageing and recommend a more inclusive approach to service design and delivery. The case study also addresses some of the issues around the language used and the culture around ageing which will contribute to a more forward thinking approach. Originality/value - This is an original case study based on the work of the BJF over a ten year period as it developed its' Positive Ageing and Positive Living programmes. BJF has been at the forefront of the positive ageing movement by developing mid-life programmes of work and is acknowledged as an expert organisation in the field of intergenerational (and now multi-generational) practice and age friendly communities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.917891865
29,The eldercare factory,"Rapid advances in service robotics together with dramatic shifts in population demographics have led to the notion that technology may be the answer to our eldercare problems. Robots are being developed for feeding, washing, lifting, carrying and mobilising the elderly as well as monitoring their health. They are also being proposed as a substitute for companionship. While these technologies could accrue major benefits for society and empower the elderly, we must balance their use with the ethical costs. These include a potential reduction in human contact, increased feeling of objectification and loss of control, loss of privacy and personal freedom as well as deception and infantilisation. With appropriate guidelines in place before the introduction of robots en masse into the care system, robots could improve the lives of the elderly, reducing their dependence and creating more opportunities for social interaction. Without forethought, the elderly may find themselves in a barren world of machines, a world of automated care: a factory for the elderly. © 2011 S.

356,Urinary incontinence in nursing homes: Epidemiology and management guidelines,"Adherence to guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary incontinence (UI) is essential for all primary care providers. Growing evidence indicates that with appropriate management, the morbidity and cost of UI can be greatly reduced, and the quality of life and physical health of nursing home residents can be drastically improved. Although the prevalence of UI in women increases with age, its absence in over half of all women suggests that it is not a normal part of aging. Studies have shown that the prevalence of incontinence in elderly people in nursing homes reaches 50%, greater than that among age-matched women residing in the community. It is associated with substantial physical and psychosocial morbidity. Additional serious consequences may include depression, inactivity, and social isolation. Moreover, incontinence has been associated with multiple hospital admissions and is believed to be one of the major causes of institutionalization of the elderly. The pathogenesis in nursing home residents is often multifactorial and has been associated with depression, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cerebrovascular disease, impairments of cognitive and physical function, fecal incontinence, impaired ability to ambulate, and dementia. Guidelines for diagnosis and management of UI in aging and institutionalized women are presented to assist primary care givers in the diagnosis and treatment of women with UI. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

156,Perception and negative effect of loneliness in a Chicago Chinese population of older adults,"This qualitative study aims to investigate the cultural understandings of loneliness, identify the contexts of loneliness, and to examine its effect on the health and well-being of U.S. Chinese older adults. Despite loneliness is one of the main indicators of well-being, little attention has been paid to understanding loneliness among immigrant older adults. This study utilizes both survey questionnaires and semi-structured focus group methods to investigate the feelings of loneliness among U.S. Chinese older adults. Based on interviews with 78 community-dwelling Chinese older adults in Chicago Chinatown, this community-based participatory research study (CBPR) shows loneliness is common among U.S. Chinese older adults. It was frequently identified through emotional isolation and social isolation. Social, psychological and physical health factors could contribute to the experience of loneliness. In addition, the health of older adults with loneliness may be associated with worsening overall health, elder mistreatment, health behavior changes and increased healthcare utilizations. This study has implications for healthcare professionals, social services agencies and policy makers. Our findings point to the needs for healthcare professionals to be more alert of the association of loneliness and adverse health outcomes. Communities and social services agencies should collectively take a lead in reducing social isolation, improving intergenerational relationships, and increasing social networks and companionship for this group of vulnerable older adults. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.1181707219
90,It pushed me back into the human race': Evaluative findings from a community Christmas event,"Many older people in Britain spend Christmas day alone. The Christmas period may be especially difficult for older people who are socially isolated, living with dementia or who have physical impairments, and may feel particularly marginalised at this time of year. This paper draws on evaluative research findings from a community Christmas event held in December 2014 at the University of Salford for older people and their carers who would be on their own on Christmas day. A multi-method approach was employed, seven guests took part in semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences and perceptions of the event, seven staff and student volunteers participated in a group interview to explore and discuss their participation in the event. Data collection took place during April and May 2015. Interview transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. Three overarching themes were identified from the interviews: 'reasons for participants attending the event', 'a different Christmas day: the impact on guests and volunteers', and 'learning, planning and moving forwards'. The findings illustrate that a range of people participated in the Christmas day event for a variety of reasons. The event itself had a positive impact, including the shared experience of social belonging, for all involved. There are tangible longer term benefits as a result of the event, such as ongoing contact between participants and the development of supportive networks in the local community. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3406918453
79,Design and development a social networks platform for older people,"According to the previous clinical studies, the social contact will be influenced on the life quality and health of elders. Hence, in health care for elders, how to maintain their social relationship is of primary importance. Recently, Morris proposed a conceptual model to address social isolations in a way similar to social index which can assist the elders to perceive and maintain their own social network with others whom have been previously strong ties. However, we found some drawbacks in Morris's study in display, function, cost, etc; therefore we proposed a novel social network platform attempting to display one personal social situation by using the simply behavioral feedback from the members in his/her social network. This platform includes the following properties: Addressing different information literacy and culture gap between two generations by integrating existing communication and VOIP (Voice over IP) application software into our platform, Allowing both online and offline communication, Displaying social feedback in the users' screen directly. Finally, in our study, we will adopt the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) to validate the user's acceptance in using our developed platform. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.8933886091
241,Rural nursing education: A photovoice perspective,"Introduction: For many rural Canadians nursing care is the primary and often the sole access point to health care. As such, rural nurses are an invaluable resource to the health and wellbeing of rural populations. However, due to a nursing workforce that is aging and retiring, limited resources and support, healthcare reform issues, and other factors, these rural professionals are in short supply. Because of limited opportunities to learn about rural practice settings, nursing students may be reluctant to select rural practice locations. Relevant and effective educational initiatives are needed to attract nursing students to underserved rural and remote communities so that rural people receive the health care they require. The purpose of this study was to explore the use of the innovative research approach called photovoice as an educational strategy to foster learning about and interest in rural locations and rural nursing as future practice settings. Fostering of interest in rural may help to address nursing workforce shortages in rural settings. Methods: Thirty-eight third and fourth year nursing and health sciences students enrolled in an elective 'Rural Nursing' course used the qualitative research method photovoice to take photographs that represented challenges and facilitators of rural nursing practice. They then engaged in written reflection about their photos. Photos were to be taken in rural settings of their choice, thus fostering both urban and rural student exposure to diverse rural communities. Results: One hundred forty-four photos and reflections were submitted, representing students' appreciation of diverse facilitators and challenges to rural nursing practice. Facilitators included technology, a generalist role, strong sense of community, and slower pace of life. Challenges included inadequate rural education in undergraduate nursing programs, professional isolation, safety issues, few opportunities for professional development, lack of anonymity, and insider/outsider status. Exemplar photos and reflections are provided. Conclusion: The photovoice research approach used in this rural education endeavour proved to be very useful in fostering students' exposure to, interest in, and understanding of rural settings and their influence on rural nursing practice. Photovoice is also recommended for use in rural courses other than nursing. Suggested strategies include group photovoice experience and the expansion of reflection to enhance rural health research. © B Leipert, E Anderson, 2012.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3144986929
230,The role of social isolation in frequent and/or avoidable hospitalisation: Rural community-based service providers' perspectives,"Background. Research on frequent or avoidable hospital admission has not focussed on the perspectives of service providers or rural settings. The link between social isolation and admission is not well explored, although social isolation is known to have negative health effects. Objective. This paper reports further analysis from a study investigating service providers' perspectives on factors influencing frequent hospital admission in older patients with chronic disease, and explores the perceived role of social isolation. Methods. Semi-structured interviews with 15 purposively sampled community-based service providers in rural New South Wales, Australia were thematically analysed. Results. Social isolation was repeatedly identified as an important contributory factor in frequent and/or avoidable admission. Patients were described as socially isolated in three broad and interrelating ways: living alone, not socialising and being isolated from family. Social isolation was perceived to contribute to admission by limiting opportunities offered by social interaction, including opportunities for: improving mental health, pain tolerance and nutritional status; facilitating access to services; reinforcing healthful behaviours; and providing a monitoring role. Conclusions. Social isolation is perceived to contribute to admission in ways that may be amenable to intervention. Further research is needed to understand patients' perspectives on the role of social isolation in admission, in order to inform policy and programs aimed at reducing hospitalisation among older people with chronic disease. What is known about the topic? Social isolation has been shown to adversely affect physical health and mental health and wellbeing across a range of populations. However, less is known about the influence of social isolation on hospital admission among older people with chronic disease, and in particular in instances where admission might have been avoided. What does this paper add? This paper adds to our understanding of the ways in which social isolation might link to hospital admission among older people with chronic conditions. It does this by reporting the perspectives of community-based service providers with many years' experience of working with this patient group. What are the implications for practitioners? Practitioners need to consider the wider determinants of hospital admission among older patients with chronic disease, including social structures and support. For policy makers the implications are to review support for such patients and explore the possible impact of reducing social isolation on hospital admission. © AHHA 2013.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.8809776094
128,Toward an age-friendly city: The constraints preventing the elderly's participation in community programs in Akita city,"Purpose - The inclusion of the elderly in community life is a major factor in achieving an age-friendly city. However, there has been little research investigating the constraints preventing the elderly's interaction with society. With that in mind, this paper is pioneering the investigation of such constraints. Design/methodology/approach - This paper used the results from the ""Questionnaire towards an Age-Friendly City"" by Japan's Akita City, a member of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities. Findings - This paper reveals two constraining factors. First, living solo discourages elderly to interact with society. Second, the elderly who cannot drive a car tend to be reluctant to participate in social activities. Practical implications - To be age-friendly that encourages the elderly to participate in community life, municipalities may apply the following ""implementations for practice"": implementing regular visits to the elderly who live alone; giving young people some incentives (e.g. tax reductions) to live with their aged parents/relatives; increasing the number of community buses in order to encourage the elderly to go out; and increasing community taxis by deregulating the industry. Originality/value - This paper contributes significantly to the study of the elderly's inclusion in community life, which is a major component of an age-friendly city. Although little research has analyzed the constraints preventing the elderly's social interaction due to data limitations, this pioneering paper identifies at least some of the constraints. This research can help to improve the health and wellbeing of elderly individuals in our society and it can help to create more age-friendly cities. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

265,Characteristics associated with willingness to participate in a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial using home-based personal computers and a webcam,"Background: Trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline through cognitive stimulation among those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment are of significant importance in delaying the onset of dementia and reducing dementia prevalence. One challenge in these prevention trials is sample recruitment bias. Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active, in relatively good health, and have high educational levels and cognitive function. These participants' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and, more importantly, mask trial effects. We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers, a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. To examine the selectivity of samples, we conducted a mass mail-in survey distribution among community-dwelling older adults, assessing factors associated with a willingness to participate in the trial. Methods: Two thousand mail-in surveys were distributed to retirement communities in order to collect data on demographics, the nature and frequency of social activities, personal computer use and additional health-related variables, and interest in the prevention study. We also asked for their contact information if they were interested in being contacted as potential participants in the trial. Results: Of 1,102 surveys returned (55.1% response rate), 983 surveys had complete data for all the variables of interest. Among them, 309 showed interest in the study and provided their contact information (operationally defined as the committed with interest group), 74 provided contact information without interest in the study (committed without interest group), 66 showed interest, but provided no contact information (interest only group), and 534 showed no interest and provided no contact information (no interest group). Compared with the no interest group, the committed with interest group were more likely to be personal computer users (odds ratio (OR)=2.78), physically active (OR=1.03) and had higher levels of loneliness (OR=1.16). Conclusion: Increasing potential participants' familiarity with a personal computer and the internet before trial recruitment could increase participation rates and improve the generalizability of future studies of this type. © 2014 Dodge et al.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.4328549267
69,Only available to a selected few? Is it feasible to rely on a volunteer workforce for complex intervention delivery?,"This paper recounts the process of undertaking a randomised controlled trial which was designed to examine the effectiveness of an intervention for socially isolated older people aged 75 years and over. It describes the reasons for early cessation of the study and raises the implications of this outcome for policy, practice and research. The intervention under investigation was designed to alleviate loneliness and foster companionship. It involves participants being linked with a small group of others through a teleconferencing system with each group being facilitated by trained volunteers. There was a requirement to recruit and train a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 60 volunteers over 1 year to facilitate 20 friendship groups to meet the number of older people required to be recruited to the study. Problems with recruiting and retaining the volunteer workforce by the voluntary sector organisation, who were commissioned to do so, led to the study closing even though older people were recruited in sufficient numbers. The paper draws upon analysis of various data sources from the study to identify the potential reasons. The discussion raises considerations regarding the extent of infrastructure required to deliver community services to vulnerable user groups at scale, identifies some of the issues that need to be addressed if such volunteer-initiated services are to be successful and informs future research programmes in this area. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6741632278
34,From high connectivity to social isolation: Communication practices of older adults in the digital age,"Few studies have shown how older adults cope with communication in an age of social media where many people are in constant contact with one another. To address this, we have studied the current living and communication practices of twelve older adults using in-depth interviews and home tours. Our findings illustrate a range of routines including a preference to stay away from new technologies; high degrees of connectivity and social media acceptance; withdrawal from heavy communication to explore newfound 'me' time; and, a lack of reciprocation in communication that caused a degree of isolation. © 2012 Authors.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.8509637753
222,e-health program for patients with chronic disease,"The aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and benefits of a computer Internet-based videoconferencing healthcare support program for community-dwelling older adults with chronic disease. Eighteen participants (n = 18) who met inclusion criteria were recruited from a community health clinic, provided informed signed consent, and were assigned in groups of six to an Internetbased support group program. Where needed, participants were supplied equipment (computers, Web cams, audio headsets) and trained to access an easy-to-use, password-protected Web site that uses videoconferencing to support group member-facilitator interactive communication. The aim of the intervention was to support group member bonding and sharing of challenges and strategies for managing a chronic disease. Following 10 weekly professionally facilitated sessions, the groups met weekly in a self-help mode for an additional 3 months. Participants were interviewed at 6-month follow-up. An interview guide was used to gain feedback on using the Internet to access a health service and to ask about the benefits of having participated in the videoconferencing support group program. At follow-up, participants responded positively to using technology to communicate with healthcare professionals and other group members. They also valued the information shared regarding self-care, and reported reduction in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our Internet-based, videoconferencing intervention program can be viewed as a prototype for designing technology platforms for the delivery of professional healthcare services to home-based older adults with chronic disease. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,0,not OA,1,,,,,0.5542960734
342,Chronic diseases and depression: The modifying role of psychosocial resources,"Psychosocial coping resources have been found to protect against depressive symptoms in people with and without chronic diseases. It has not been established, however, whether these resources have the same effects across patients with different diseases. Therefore, the aim of the study was to estimate the direct and buffer effects of psychosocial resources on depression, and to examine whether these effects are different for various chronic diseases. Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. In all, 2288 community-dwelling respondents (age 55-85) were included and followed for a maximum of 6 years. Depressive symptoms (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale), the presence of seven frequently occurring chronic diseases, social support and personal coping resources, physical functioning and sociodemographic variables were assessed by structured interviews. Generalized estimating equation models were estimated for each disease, social support and personal coping resources. All resources, except social network size, showed a direct effect on depressive symptoms regardless of the presence of chronic diseases. Having a partner, high self-esteem, mastery, self-efficacy and feeling less lonely additionally buffered the negative effect of some, but not all, specific chronic diseases. Unexpectedly, in patients with cardiac disease, none of the psychosocial resources exerted a buffer effect on depressive symptoms. For instrumental and emotional support only direct (unfavorable) effects and no buffer effects could be observed. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that buffer effects of psychosocial resources are different across various chronic diseases. This suggests that interventions to enhance specific resources may ameliorate depressive symptoms in specific chronic patients groups. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

94,Lighten UP! A community-based group intervention to promote psychological well-being in older adults,"Objectives: Aging is often characterized by declines in physical and mental health and increased risk for depression and social isolation. A protective factor that has been found to effectively moderate these phenomena is psychological well-being. The aim of his study was to pilot test a novel group intervention (Lighten UP! program) for the promotion of psychological well-being in older adults living in the community. Methods: Lighten UP! is an eight-week program consisting of 90-minute group session designed to teach participants to identify and savor positive experiences across multiple domains of eudaimonic well-being. It was delivered to a sample of 103 men and women aged 60 or over, that were assessed pre- and post-intervention with Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale (PWB), Life Satisfaction scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Symptom Questionnaire, and items measuring sleep complaints and social well-being. Results: At the end of the eight weeks, participants reported significantly increased PWB, life satisfaction, and social well-being along with lower levels of depression and fewer physical symptoms and sleep complaints. These gains were particularly robust for individuals with lower pre-program levels of PWB. Conclusions: This pilot investigation suggests the feasibility of a short group program for enhancing well-being in older adults. Future controlled investigations with long-term follow-up assessment are needed to confirm the effectiveness and sustained benefits of the Lighten UP! program. © 2015 Taylor & Francis",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.480913438

This paper presents a typology of support networks found amongst older people living in the community. The distinguishing features of five different types of networks are described and a risk profile for each network type is presented. It is shown that different networks have different strengths and weaknesses and that the nature of potential risks is related to the type of support network. Further, the paper addresses the significance of the identification of support network for practice, decision making and intervention with particular reference to: social isolation, hospital discharge, admissions to residential care and mental illness.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.0007014252209
237,Evaluating negative-symptom-like behavioural changes in developmental models of schizophrenia,"Many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia has a major developmental component and that environmental factors that disrupt key stages of development, such as maternal stress during pregnancy as a result of infection or malnutrition, can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life. This review examines how non-clinical neurodevelopmental models pertinent to schizophrenia have been evaluated for their ability to reproduce behavioural deficits related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The more frequently used are the prenatal application of the mitotoxic agent methylazoxymethanol, prenatal immune challenge and the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion model. In general they have been extensively evaluated in models considered relevant to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, very few studies have examined tests related to negative symptoms and, when they have, it has almost exclusively been a social interaction model. Other aspects related to negative symptoms such as anhedonia, affective flattening and avolition have almost never been studied. Further studies examining other components of negative symptomatology are needed to more clearly associate these deficits with a schizophrenia-like profile as social withdrawal is a hallmark of many disorders. Although there are no truly effective treatments for negative symptoms, better characterisation with a broader range of drugs used in schizophrenia will be necessary to better evaluate the utility of these models. In summary, developmental models of schizophrenia have been extensively studied as models of positive symptoms but, given the unmet need in the clinic, the same effort now needs to be made with regard to negative symptoms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2459041442
67,Socially networked or isolated? Differentiating older adults and the role of tablets and television,"Population is aging. With it comes social isolation which leads to drastic health degrading situations. Facebook has the potential to assist older adults in maintaining relationships. Still problems like unclear purposes, design complexity and privacy issues have contributed to a lower uptake. We conducted a study to understand how to draw Facebook closer to older adults, investigate the main difficulties and motivations towards its use and adoption, and inquire about the possibilities of using Tablet and Television as alternatives to the traditional PC for accessing this kind of services. Findings show correlations between self-belief in technical skills, motor limitations, and tablet use and the use of Facebook. It also shows that the complexity of Facebook’s user interface limits its use by the older adults that use it and works as a barrier for its adoption by the seniors who still don’t. We also identified distinct groups and distinct feelings about the use of Television as a vehicle for social interaction. We derived a set of recommendations to consider when designing solutions for tackling social isolation. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.4205308188
20,Service-learning computing courses assist with technology needs in community based organizations serving older adults,"The rapidly exploding aged 60 and over population is expected to comprise 22% of the general population by 2020 and is the same age group which has the greatest digital divide. The senior citizen population in New York is notably higher than the national average. The high tech world that surrounds the older adult population relies on smartphones to servers and being connected to the Internet. The elderly have nothing to relate technology to in their past learning experiences, thus find it difficult to incorporate computing skills into long-term memory. Many senior citizens know they have to learn how to operate a computer because the world will leave them behind. The Internet proves essential to the elderly in not only connecting with family, friends, and lost acquaintances, thus avoiding social isolation, but provides valuable health related information and healthcare options. Moreover, research has shown frequent Internet use by older adults stimulates cognition. Other studies have shown technology enriches daily functions and improves the overall life quality of older adults. Older adults are often not comfortable with the swiftly advancing technology. Many older adults feel computers are intimidating and fear breaking the machine, thus reluctant to learn how to use them. Furthermore, many residents in skilled nursing facilities have hearing, visual, and motor skill impairments making computer utilization an immense challenge. Thus, this aged population that has so much to gain from using a computer for email, web surfing, online shopping, and connecting to the world around them are often unwilling or unable to operate a computer. The core of the research project discussed in this paper is a unique course entitled, Intergenerational Computing. Intergenerational Computing is an undergraduate service-learning course offered within the school of computer science for non-majors in collaboration with nursing faculty. Students enrolled in the course provide technology instruction to older adults as part of their service-learning experience. Older adults receive individualized tutoring in a non-threatening learning environment. Student-teachers assist to overcome the computer fears of the elderly while the elderly learn a new set of communication skills, while being mentally challenged. Other computing courses, including Computer Systems and Hardware, as well as Networking Technologies, contain service-learning term projects in the curriculum. Students select to build computer labs, install networks, and distribute refurbished computer equipment to disadvantaged senior citizens. Some students additionally chose to modify traditional mice and develop prototypes of Nintendo Wii™ remotes to be more accessible to older adults. Other students have installed software and hardware in computer labs, as well as virtually designed housing for a livable community project via Second Life all specifically for the benefit of senior citizens. This paper presents a research project including objectives, description, assessments, lessons learned, and suggestions for successful replication. Tips for low or no budget training, as well as guidance for integrating service-learning projects into the IT course syllabus will be discussed. © 2011 IEEE.",0,0,"no intervention, no remote, no SI",0,,,,,0.9044105783
166,The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a participative community singing programme as a health promotion initiative for older people: Protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: The growth in numbers of older people represents a considerable cost to health and social care services in the United Kingdom. There is an acknowledged need to address issues of social exclusion and both the physical and mental health of this age group. In recent years there has been much interest in the potential contribution of the arts to the health of communities and individuals. There is some evidence that participative singing may be of benefit to older people, however studies to date are limited in number and have lacked rigour. There is therefore a need to build on this knowledge base to provide more quantifiable evidence of both effectiveness and cost effectiveness of singing as a health intervention for this population group. Methods. The proposed study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. The primary hypothesis is that singing groups for older people improve both physical and mental aspects of quality of life when compared to usual activities. Potential participants will be volunteers over 60 years living in the community and recruited through publicity. Eligible and consenting participants will be randomized to either a singing group or a control group. Singing groups will take part in a twelve week planned programme of singing and control groups will continue with usual activities. The primary outcome measure will be the York SF-12, a health related quality of life measure which will be administered at baseline, three and six months after baseline. The study will evaluate both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Discussion. This study proposes to add to the existing body of evidence on the value of singing for older people by using a rigorous methodological design, which includes a power calculation, a standardised intervention and assessment of cost-effectiveness. It should be regarded as a stage in a progressive programme of studies in this area. If group singing is found to be effective and cost-effective it may offer an alternative means to maintaining the health of people in later life. Trial Registration.

294,Nutritional screening strategy in nonagenarians: The value of the MNA-SF (Mini Nutritional Assessment short form) in NutriAction,"Objectives: To identify older subjects at risk of malnutrition using the most appropriate tool available for the specific setting and to evaluate the Mini Nutritional Assessment short form (MNA-SF) in a sample of nonagenarians. Design: Questionnaire based national screening week for the risk and prevalence of malnutrition in older people (NutriAction). Setting: Older people in the community (CD) and in nursing homes (NH). Participants: General practices (n=70) and Nursing Homes (n=70). Measurements: Questionnaire based on items from validated screening instruments: the MNA-SF, the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and additional clinically relevant parameters (mobility, independence, social isolation and co-morbidities). Results: In total 5,334 people were screened of which 16% were aged over 90 years. In this age group, 66% of the screened individuals were at risk of malnutrition (MNA ≤ 11), and women were affected significantly more than men (p<0.001). Actual malnutrition was present in 22% (BMI <20), 20% (SNAQ) and 25% (clinical evaluation). The MNA appeared to be very sensitive but had a low specificity as well in the nonagenarians (98% and 44%) as in the younger old (97% and 52%). The SNAQ was not a sensitive tool for detecting malnutrition in this study population (25%). Although clinical impression had a low sensitivity (60-61%) it has a good specificity (86% in 90+ and 91% below 90yr). Conclusion: The overall risk of and the prevalence of malnutrition is common in older people. The prevalence is higher in women, in nursing homes and in older age groups. The MNA-SF followed by a clinical subjective evaluation seems to be the preferred strategy for detecting malnutrition in nonagenarians. © 2013 Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4418202672
345,Under-nutrition in older people: A serious and growing global problem!,"Everyone agrees that adequate nutrient intake is important to all living things. Without food or water, life on earth would cease to exist. In the field of medical health, some gains have been made in meeting maternal and child nutritional needs. There is great community awareness regarding the importance of meeting the nutritional needs of the developing foetus and child. Malnutrition secondary to decreased intake in older people and weight loss is also a serious problem with unfortunately, very little notice from the community at large. As one ages, several physiological processes may contribute towards the development of protein energy malnutrition. Under-nutrition in older people is sadly far too common, even in developed countries. It is very likely that the same concerted effort used to address child malnutrition is required to combat under-nutrition in our elders. Protein energy malnutrition in older people comes at a significant cost to the individual, families, communities and the healthcare system. Failure to address this syndrome is not only unethical and unhealthy, but also costly. Vigilance and community awareness is important in ensuring that this important syndrome is detected and managed appropriately. This review mainly attempts to describe the pathophysiology, prevalence and consequences of under-nutrition and aims to highlight the importance of this clinical syndrome and the recent growth in our understanding of the processes behind its development. Some management strategies are also briefly described. © Copyright 2003 Journal of Postgraduate Medicine.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1299366663
228,A qualitative study on ageing related anxiety among middle aged women in Malaysia,"Ageing anxiety is commoner among women compared to men. However, little is known on the possible contributing factors towards the development of ageing related anxiety among Malaysian women. This study aimed to explore ageing anxiety among the middle-aged women in Malaysia in facing the ageing process. Series of 6 focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted involving a total of 36 women aged between 35 and 59 years old. Each FGD consisted of 5 to 7 respondents and was conducted for an average of 1 to 2 hours. The respondents were selected using the maximum variation sampling method focussing on five age categories, between 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54 and 55 to 59 years old. Representative from several residential areas in the area of Putrajaya Federal Territory and Seri Kembangan, Selangor were involved in the selection of respondents. The interviews revealed that, majority of the respondents were seriously thinking of the possible negative experiences associated with ageing and being old, but very few experiencing ageing anxiety. Three main themes that were identified to contribute to the ageing anxiety were issues related to caregiving at old age and fear of loneliness, the welfare and care of their children when they are old and eventually die and also physical changes that occurred with ageing process. These themes were not specifically associated with any particular age groups, marital or income status. However, the development of the ageing anxiety was found to be related to their personal experiences and observations from the surrounding community. The findings show that women in Malaysia are still emphasizing on the importance of traditional caregiving system, where elderly parents are looked after by the children or extended family members rather than living in formal institutions. Despite the important role of formal institutions in the care of elderly people in the future, it is still negatively perceived. With the shrinking of the size of nuclear family and massive involvement of women in employment sector, more elderly will be expected to reside in formal institutions in the near future. Relevant authorities should be made aware on the importance to maintain the quality of care in the formal institution for elderly, in order to tackle the negative perceptions.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.6658200129
363,A 15 year retrospective review of homicide in the elderly,"With constant improvements in socioeconomic conditions, the people of most industrialized nations are living longer. Most elderly individuals lead productive lives within the community. Unfortunately, when elderly individuals suffer from a debilitating disease or injury, society seems ill- equipped to care for them. The frailty and social isolation that comes will illness or advanced age renders the elderly more vulnerable to crime. This study examines the circumstances that surround homicides of those 65 years of age or older which occurred in Jefferson County, Alabama over a 15 year span. We conducted a retrospective study of all decedents brought to the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner Office dining the 15 years from 1981-1995. A computer search identified 150 homicide virus who were 65 years or older. In these 150 cases the causes of death were as follows: gunshot wound 50%, blunt force injuries 19%, knife wounds 14%, and asphyxiation 10%. Younger homicide victims were much less likely to be killed as the result of a direct physical assault; blunt force injuries and asphyxiation combined caused death in only 7% of the younger population. Robbery was the most common motive for death in the elderly population, which accounted for 37% of cases. The most common location for homicides in the elderly population was in their own residence, which accounted for 71% of cases. Four elderly homicide victims were shot by the police. Three elderly decedents died as a result of abuse.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5305445246

The rates for organic brain syndrome range from 4-24 per cent. This study included the collection of medical, social and psychiatric histories in subjects' own homes, wherein their social circumstances could be evaluated and their family and friends could be met.

89,Co-producing Approaches to the Management of Dementia through Social Prescribing,"A promising approach to the management of dementia is 'social prescribing'. Social prescribing is a form of 'co-production' that involves linking patients with non-clinical activities, typically delivered by voluntary and community groups, in an effort to improve their sense of well-being. The success of social prescribing depends upon the ability of boundary-spanning individuals within service delivery organizations to develop referral pathways and collaborative relationships through 'networks'. This article examines the operation of a pilot social prescribing programme in the North East of England, targeted at older people with early onset dementia and depression, at risk of social isolation. It is argued that the scheme was not sustained, in part, because the institutional logics that governed the actions of key boundary-spanning individuals militated against the collaboration necessary to support co-production. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.01758516726
220,Being single in old age,"The routine, everyday life of single elders differs from that of other old people. On the basis of interview data both about themselves and some aspects of the quality of their everyday lives, it is proposed that single elders constitute a distinct type of social personality in old age. Interviews provide subjective and methodological evidence to support this. The 'normal,' taken for granted social world of single elders is: relatively isolated; but not perceived in terms of loneliness, at present or anticipated; and considered an ordinary extension of their past. Death is conceived as 'just another' event of their ongoing experiences.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.214604548
134,Perceived Social Support of Older Adults in Spain,"Based on theory, perceived social support is a relevant multidimensional factor for the wellbeing and quality of life of older adults. However, not all measuring instruments are able to identify this multidimensionality in every population. In this sense, the objectives of this paper are: 1) to identify the dimensions underlying the social support perceived by older adults in Spain, using the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire (DUFSS); 2) to interpret how this population group rates the support it receives in the dimensions found; and 3) to determine the (fundamentally dynamic or stable) nature of the relationship between these dimensions and socio-demographic, personal, and family and friendship network-related factors. The data come from a Quality of Life survey conducted in 2008 among people aged 60 or over living in a community dwelling in Spain. The sample comprised 1106 individuals. The analysis of the dimensionality using the DUFSS scale through an exploratory factor analysis identified a sole dimension for this specific population, perceived affective support. The affective support perceived by 35% of older adults could be categorized as insufficient, according to the descriptive statistics of this scale and their reflection in the average level of loneliness measured by the De Jong Gierveld short loneliness scale (ANOVA Analysis). Standard multiple regression analysis suggests that the perception of affective support by older adults in Spain does not vary substantially depending on the factors analysed. The results offer signs that support the studies that defend the mainly stable nature of social perceived social support. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V./The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS).",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3993482922
249,Sequential analysis of juvenile isolation-induced decreased social behavior in the adult rat,"The consequences of juvenile isolation on adult social behavior were studied in detail using two different analysis methods: frequency, duration, and latency of behavioral elements, and sequential analysis. Rats were either isolated or socially housed during weeks 4 and 5 of age, and after the isolation period housed in pairs with a rat of identical housing condition until the time of testing at 12 weeks of age. Juvenile isolation caused marked effects on the frequency, duration, and latency of various social behavioral elements, whereas the non-social activities such as ambulation, rearing, and self-grooming were hardly affected. Juvenile isolation reduced social exploration, anogenital sniffing, and approach/following and increased the latency to the first occurrence of these social behavioral elements. In contrast, the sequential analysis revealed that the structure of social behavior was barely affected by juvenile isolation. Some transitions were less pronounced in juvenile isolated rats compared to non-isolated rats, but no significant differences were observed in transitions between social elements. Thus, juvenile isolation bisected the time spent on adult social interactions, whereas it did not disrupt the sequential structure of social behavior. The present data suggest that juvenile isolation reduced the motivation for adult social behavior, but when social contact is initiated, a relatively normal social behavioral pattern is displayed.

191,Loneliness as a predictor of quality of life among older caregivers,"Aim. This paper reports a study investigating quality of life in relation to loneliness, caregiving, social network, gender, age and economic status among caregiving men and women in a population-based sample aged 75 years or older. Background. Because of demographic changes, in the future more care for older people will be given by informal caregivers who are themselves older. Being old and caring for another older person may affect various aspects of life, such as physical and emotional health and decreased time for respite, which may affect social life and quality of life. Method. A postal questionnaire including the Short Form Health Survey was used. The sample consisted of 4278 people, aged 75 years and over, living in Sweden. Of these, 783 (18%) were caregivers. Findings. Caregivers had a larger social network and reported feelings of loneliness less often than non-caregivers. Forty per cent of caregivers helped every day. There were gender differences in experiences of loneliness during the last year, with the frequency of intense feelings of loneliness being higher among women. Loneliness and a small or non-existent network were significantly associated with low quality of life among caregivers, as well as in the total sample. The results showed significant association between loneliness, weak social network and low mental quality of life. Conclusions. The fact that loneliness was the most important factor predicting low quality of life among caregivers, as well as older people in general, indicates that it is crucial in the care of older people. From a nursing perspective, the findings indicate the advantage of helping older people to keep up and develop their social networks. Nursing care should involve steps to maintain the social network before an older person becomes too weak, since decreased health status makes social contacts more difficult.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7191933732
91,I come for the friendship': Why social eating matters,"Objectives: To explore an innovative social eating programme model for older Tasmanians, Eating with Friends (EWF), from the perspectives of its participants, to establish how successfully it is meeting the organisational aims of strengthening community, reducing social isolation and enhancing mental well-being. Methods: Focus groups and in-depth interviews, together with brief individual questionnaires, were undertaken with participants in four EWF groups: two urban and two rural, and with two well-established and two recently established groups. Results: The study found that EWF was meeting the social eating needs of its participants, doing so through nurturing a sense of community. Conclusion: The flexible model used by EWF was key to its success in achieving its aims. This allowed individual groups to evolve in ways which fitted the needs and aspirations of participants. While participants enjoyed their meals, the social environment and meal settings were determining factors for ongoing participation in EWF. © 2016 ACOTA.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2530264671
295,Evaluating travel training in northern Sydney: Methodological and practical issues,"Growth in the relative size of the population of older people has led to increased demand for community transport services, especially from people who are no longer able to travel safely in their own cars. A proportion of these people could use mainstream public transport but, through lack of experience, do not know how so they turn to more expensive community transport services. Travel training addresses this issue. It is targeted at all potential public transport users who need some assistance or guidance to get started. This policy has potential to be a win-win for government and individuals by increasing public transport patronage, improving mobility (and quality of life) of trainees and their carers, and relieving pressure on the community transport sector enabling it to reduce 'unmet need'. Travel training is most effective in cities: public transport networks are established and there are significant pockets of potential trainees. Travel training has grown strongly in the US, driven by the positive benefits for all parties compared with the relatively low cost of the training. Attempts to quantify the benefits of travel training have to date been narrowly focused. This paper uses data from the Travel Training Project in Northern Sydney to develop and apply a broad evaluation framework encompassing measurable economic, social and environmental outcomes. The framework makes use of standard parameters such as value of time where possible. It also includes the application of theory from other disciplines to measure social and environmental benefits. The evaluation of the Travel Training Project in Northern Sydney results in significant benefit-cost ratios. The evaluation gives benefit-cost ratios, differentiating groups of potential travel trainees. The paper provides results to assist prioritisation of trainees that lead to higher benefit-cost ratios, and policy development.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.947532947
377,Young elderly between activity and fragility: Challenges and resources linked to longer life expectancies [Anziani giovani tra activity e fragilità: sfide e risorse connesse all'allungamento della vita],"Population ages, yet many older adults today enjoy good health conditions and continue playing an active role in their social networks and in society. At the same time, there is growing attention of researchers and policy makers, also in terms of prevention, about the older adults&#39; well-being as a protective factor against early withdrawal, physical and cognitive decline, social isolation. The purpose of this work is to present the results of an empirical research aimed at highlighting (a) the role that social and health services, (b) the use of PC and Internet for health-related issues and (c) the presence of support networks play in promoting and maintaining the well-being in the population of young-elderly Italians, suffering from chronic or long-term illness (with or without limitation) (N = 371). Statistical analyzes show that the relation between well-being, health and active aging is not unidirectional, that the perception of self as old has a significant impact on the well-being and self-perception is determined by health conditions. In general, the healthier the subjects, the more satisfied, more engaged in relational networks, more physically and culturally active and more predisposed to engage themselves in various fields of activity.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.301736975
116,"Social support, social strain, loneliness, and well-being among older adults: An analysis of the Health and Retirement Study*","This study proposed that, among older adults, higher support and lower strain received from each of the four relational sources (spouse/partner, children, family, and friends) were associated with reduced loneliness and improved well-being and that loneliness might mediate the relationship between support/strain and well-being. Structural equation modeling was conducted using a national sample of adults aged 50 years and older (N = 7,367) from the Health and Retirement Study. Findings indicated that support from spouse/partner and friends alleviated loneliness, while strain from all the four sources intensified loneliness; higher support and lower strain from various sources directly and indirectly improved well-being, with indirect effects mediated through reduced loneliness. It was concluded that, in later life, various sources of support/strain engender distinct effects on loneliness and well-being, and loneliness serves as one of the psychological pathways linking support/strain to well-being. © The Author(s) 2013.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6329299922
382,The implications of information and communication technology use for the social well-being of older adults,"Older adults, comprising a population segment more vulnerable to social isolation during the late life stages, are more likely to be excluded from the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as well as from the focus of ICT research. Addressing this research gap concerning the currently fastest growing sector of ICT users this study centers on the disparities regarding older adults’ ICT access and use. Because the effects of ICTs cannot be uniform for all users, the digital inequalities older adults experience might have different influences on their social lives when compared to other populations that have been studied in the previous literature. Drawing on surveys from 1780 older adults, ages 60 years and older, residing in six suburbs in the Chicago area, this research links older adults’ digital inequalities to their social well-being. We demonstrate that while socio-economic status remains the major factor affecting their quality of life, social and instrumental ICT uses can also contribute to their well-being in varied and unexpected ways. From these results, we draw implications for the study of digital disparities by examining how the impacts of ICTs vary by differential uses and different age groups. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.1019761907
331,Sleep complaints in community-living older persons: A multifactorial geriatric syndrome (See editorial comments by Dr. Michael V. Vitiello on pp 1882-1883),"In older persons, sleep complaints in the form of insomnia and daytime drowsiness are highly prevalent and are associated with adverse outcomes. The underlying mechanisms are linked to age-related declines in physiology (normal aging) and age-related increases in disease prevalence (usual aging). This article describes how normal aging leads to less-restorative sleep, characterized by reductions in homeostatic and circadian sleep, and to phase advancement of the sleep-wake cycle, characterized by older persons being more alert in the early morning but drowsier in the early evening. It also describes how usual aging leads to sleep complaints through reductions in health status, loss of physical function, and primary sleep disorders. Psychosocial influences are likewise described, and their relevance to sleep complaints is discussed. These aging-related changes are subsequently incorporated into a conceptual model that describes sleep complaints as a consequence of multiple and interdependent predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors, akin to a geriatric syndrome. The discussion concludes by applying the conceptual model to the sleep-related care of an older person with insomnia and daytime drowsiness and suggesting that the diagnostic assessment consider, in addition to primary sleep disorders, multiple domains, including medical, physical, cognitive, psychological, and social matters, with the intent of developing an overall therapeutic plan and establishing long-term follow-up. © 2007, The American Geriatrics Society.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9591115608

142,Older adults with hoarding behaviour aging in place: Looking to a collaborative community-based planning approach for solutions,"This paper reports on and synthesizes new research that examines how a collaborative community response can promote successful aging in place for older adults with hoarding behaviour. Through interviews with older adults with hoarding behaviour, who used a particular community support and a focus group interview with members of the community collaborative that directed supports for this population, our findings suggest that there were valuable outcomes for both groups. These older adults with hoarding behaviour were able to remain in their own homes, their safety was enhanced, their sense of isolation was minimized, empowerment was fostered, and they gained valuable insight into their behaviour. The members of the community collaborative were able to access the expertise of other professionals, maximize their own expertise, and they generated an enhanced understanding of the experience of older adults living with hoarding behaviour in Edmonton. This study is a significant addition to the much too sparse literature about the community planning needs of older adults with hoarding behaviour. It offers knowledge that is integral to theories and principles of better aging in place but attempts to translate this into practice. © 2012 Kyle Y. Whitfield et al.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2248649778
227,"Most common mental problems in the elderly as viewed by Medical school students in Poland, Belarus and Greece","Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the opinions of respondents on the most common mental and psychological problems of the elderly over 60 years of age. Material and methods: The study was conducted between January 2013 and November 2014 in three study groups: Polish, Belarusian and Greek students. A total of 600 (200 for each group) respondents were tested with a questionnaire developed by the authors. Women dominated in study groups. Three quarters of the study population consisted of people between the ages of 21 and 25 years. An analysis of the education level of respondents showed that almost 60% of respondents studied nursing, 30% - physiotherapy and 10% - other courses of studies. Results: More than half of all respondents (50.8%) were afraid of old age. The vast majority of students in each group (a total of 88.3%) stated that it is better for the elderly not to be alone and to have a family. Loneliness (61.5%), the sense of helplessness (52.7%) and depression (50.8%) were mental problems of the elderly that were most often indicated by the respondents. Conclusions: There is a need to educate the younger generations on problems associated with aging and old age, including mental health problems. The study showed significant differences in the perception of mental health problems of elderly people, depending on respondents' country. There is a need for a change in the functioning of the care systems for the elderly, which would involve perceiving a family as an institution able to provide care services for old people. © Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.4358111186
49,Developing mobile application design of virtual pets for caring for the elderly,"In the population ageing society, the companionship and care of the elderly, the medical system, and the consumer trend cannot be neglected. The contact with the external and the ones caring about oneself is essential for the elderly. This study aims to develop application with the functions of healthcare and accompanying, and the accessibility design is included in the interface, where virtual pets are the major communication media to assist the elderly in using mobile application. The required functions and contents in mobile application as well as the preference for the interface and models of interaction for the elderly are investigated in this study. It aims to ease and convince the elderly of the easy use. In the process of cultivating and training the virtual pet mobile application, the elderly could be accompanied and reduced the sense of loneliness; in the further use and interaction with virtual pet mobile application, the physical and metal conditions of the elderly could be real-time monitored and recorded to assist monitoring stations in managing the physical conditions of the elderly and nursing personnel in periodical checks. This research is preceded as following. First, literatures are reviewed. Second, Focus Group Interview is utilized for concluding the application contents and functions and the requirements and preference of the elderly for virtual pets. Third, an application experimental prototype is designed according to such requirements and preference. Fourth, the questionnaire, aiming to test the usability of the elderly, is filled. Fifth, the principles and suggestions for mobile application design suitable for the elderly are concluded based on the test results and analyses. The research outcome would assist in and contribute to the accessibility design of mobile application and the application to medical care by providing possible solutions for insufficient caring manpower in ageing societies and uneven distribution of medical resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.8384017169
322,Investigating factors associated with depression of older women in Macau,"Background. Mental health burdens pose a grave threat to quality of life and economic productivity worldwide. Women must balance the economic, emotional and health needs of the household with their own emotional and health needs. Aims. The purpose of this study is to explore the depression level of a group of older women in the community in Macau, and to identify factors associated with depression. Design. A descriptive survey. Research method. The survey was conducted during the period July and August 2004 in six parishes in Macau; 1042 older people aged 60-98 completed a structured questionnaire. Outcome measures. Four main outcome variables were employed in the study: predisposing characteristics, physical, psychosocial and health needs/behaviours outcomes. Results. Among the women, 11·9% (n = 124) had been identified as depressed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify a model to predict older women who will have depression. The results showed that variables like having hypertension (p = 0·010), a poor social network (p < 0·001), low self-perceived scores on health status (p < 0·001) and ability to meet living costs (p < 0·001), and a low level of ability to do housework (p < 0·001) were significant risk factors for depression. Conclusion. Providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms, and maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. Apart from the findings, these conclusions resonate with recent Macau guidance on managing depression in older women. This stresses the importance of prevention, early detection and stepped care, with more intensive treatment for greater severity of illness and a multifaceted approach to management. Relevance to clinical practice. It is important to regularly screen for depressive symptoms among older women in the community. Focusing on older women with increasing physical disability and social isolation should help in both the prevention and recognition of onset of depression. Light therapy and antidepressants were suggested and providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms; maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.08550689669
122,Disrupted social connectedness in people with Parkinson's disease,"A study was conducted to explore the effects of Parkinson's disease on people's social interactions. An exploratory qualitative design was used. Participants were a purposive sample of 10 people with Parkinson's disease who were attending a hospital outpatients' neurology clinic. Data were collected by semi-structured in-depth interviews. All interviews were transcribed and analysed by using conventional content analysis to explore the participants' experiences and perceptions on social interactions, using the central question 'what effect does Parkinson's disease have on people's social interactions?' Analysis revealed that Parkinson's disease affected social interactions by disrupting social connectedness. Social connectedness was disrupted by a number of factors, including 'progressive physical disability, mood disturbances, shrinking of social activities and secluding oneself'. Older adults with Parkinson's disease therefore face a number of challenges to remaining socially connected. It appears that disrupted social connectedness is one of the negative consequences of living with Parkinson's. © 2014 MA Healthcare Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.9275135465

113,Bring on the health economists: Time for a rigorous evaluation of senior participative arts,"Purpose - As our elderly population increases, scheduled to rise by 61 per cent in the next 20 years, a national panic has set in about what to do. Antidepressant use is on the rise, and the figures for loneliness and depression skyrocketing. So far, so normal and so very disheartening. The purpose of this paper is to make a radical plea to change our thinking about how the lives of our senior citizens are lived: bring on the health economists, and let us put some serious funding into studying the effects of participative arts on the lives of older people. Design/methodology/approach - This year the author was awarded aWinston Churchill Fellowship to study participative arts for older people in the USA. The author interviewed Professor Julene Johnson of University of California San Francisco, about ""Community of Voices"" an ambitious, well-funded five year programme which is launching 12 one-year choirs with low income, non-singers, after which findings will be rigorously tested. Findings - In the USA, proper evaluation of participative arts is being taken seriously as a means of whittling down massive Medicare costs. There is evaluation going on in the UK, but much of it is flawed, usually down to cost. Evaluations generally consist of questionnaires filled in by participants. Findings centre around the psychological arena, rather than physical aspects (balance, hospital visits).

238,Psychosocial challenges and resource needs of young adult cancer survivors: Implications for program development,"Young adult (YA) cancer survivors have specific needs because of their age and life stage. The authors investigated the challenges and resource needs of YA survivors, exploring the influence of age at diagnosis (i.e., diagnosis during childhood vs. young adulthood) and the diagnosis of a brain tumor. The authors conducted four focus groups with YA survivors (N = 22, age 18-35), treated for brain tumors or other cancers in childhood (mean age at diagnosis ± SD: brain, 10.7 ± 2.86; other cancers, 10.5 ± 3.51) or as YAs (brain, 23.5 ± 4.04; other cancers, 25.6 ± 4.10). Transcripts of audiotaped sessions were coded using thematic analysis. Common challenges across the groups included physical appearance, fertility, late effects, social relationships, and changing priorities. Childhood cancer survivors struggled with identity formation, social isolation, and health care transitions. Concerns specific to survivors diagnosed as YAs included financial independence and protecting parents. Childhood brain tumor survivors struggled with cognitive deficits, limited career options, and poor social skills, whereas brain tumor survivors diagnosed as YAs emphasized cognitive decline, loss of autonomy, and living with an incurable disease. Despite the unique challenges identified, all groups described similar resource needs including peer support, age-specific information, and having health care providers proactively raise salient issues. Young adult cancer survivors have many similar psychosocial and information needs regardless of age at or type of diagnosis that differ from those of pediatric and older adult survivors. With improved survival rates, the small number of YA in any one institution will grow. It will become increasingly important to create comprehensive, age-appropriate YA programs that address overlapping and unique needs of survivors at this life stage. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2800439388
9,I feel less lonely: What older people say about participating in a social networking website,"This paper presents the findings from a qualitative pilot project that implemented an internet social networking intervention and evaluated the effect it had on older people's experience of temporal loneliness. The project was implemented over a three-month period and utilised an in-home, one-on- one education strategy. Six older people aged 69 to 85 years were recruited from a community aged care programme in South Australia. All participants were connected to the internet and provided with one-on-one tutoring in how to use the social networking site. To evaluate the project, data were collected through in-depth interviews with older people at the commencement and completion of the project. An additional interview with the community programme co-ordinator was conducted at the completion of the project. Evaluation was also guided by data collected by the research team via reflective journals. The key findings to emerge from the inductive analysis of the data resulted in four major themes, these were: the participants' experience of loneliness; technology as an enabler; providing a supportive environment; connectivity. A case study is presented to provide in-depth understanding of how social networking can help reduce the participants' experience of loneliness. The findings from this project demonstrated that the utilisation of a social networking site has the potential to reduce loneliness in older people and therefore, based on these findings, recommendations for further research and practice implementation are made. In particular the project team recommends expanding the current pilot project into a larger scale project. © Pier Professional Ltd.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.5372592733
39,0lder adults digital gameplay: A Follow-Up study of social benefits,"This study involved 20 Wii Bowling teams of 3–4 players each in an eight-week tournament across a large city in western Canada. This paper summarizes the initial results, in which an increase in social connectedness and decrease in loneliness were found, and reports on a follow-up study three months after the tournament that examined whether people still played together and maintained their social connections. The follow-up consisted of 14 focus groups, with 46 Wii Bowling players, with at least one representative from each team. Many participants seemed to maintain benefit from their new social contacts three months after the tournament. However, participants experienced some difficulties in recruiting new players and in maintaining momentum over time. In seniors’ centres and facilities with scheduled activities, Wii Bowling remained a regular source of social interaction and fun. These findings are examined with a consideration of socio-emotional selectivity theory. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,1,no remote,1,,,,,0.3779821902
64,"Mobile remote presence systems for older adults: Acceptance, benefits, and concerns","While much of human-robot interaction research focuses upon people interacting with autonomous robots, there is also much to be gained from exploring human interpersonal interaction through robots. The current study focuses on mobile remote presence (MRP) systems as used by a population who could potentially benefit from more social connectivity and communication with remote people -older adults. Communication technologies are important for ensuring safety, independence, and social support for older adults, thereby potentially improving their quality of life and maintaining their independence [24]. However, before such technologies would be accepted and used by older adults, it is critical to understand their perceptions of the benefits, concerns, and adoption criteria for MRP systems. As such, we conducted a needs assessment with twelve volunteer participants (ages 63-88), who were given first-hand experience with both meeting a visitor via the MRP system and driving the MRP system to visit that person. The older adult participants identified benefits such as being able to see and be seen via the MRP system, reducing travel costs and hassles, and reducing social isolation. Among the concerns identified were etiquette of using the MRP, personal privacy, and overuse of the system. Some new use-cases were identified that have not yet been explored in prior work, for example, going to museums, attending live performances, and visiting friends who are hospitalized. The older adults in the current study preferred to operate the MRP themselves, rather than to be visited by others operating the MRP system. More findings are discussed in terms of their implications for design.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.3354671545
309,Psychosocial correlates of aspects of sleep quality in community-dwelling Irish older adults,"Objectives: While it is known that psychosocial factors affect overall sleep quality, there is little consensus on the factors that affect different aspects of sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) provides a means of examining these separate aspects of sleep. Method: This study investigated whether the different components of the PSQI are affected by different psychosocial factors, or whether all aspects of sleep are associated with the same factors. 505 community-dwelling older adults took part in this study. Psychosocial status, comprising of measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, social and emotional loneliness and personality, was assessed for each participant. Health-related factors (pain, comorbidities, polypharmacy) as well as age and gender were also measured. Results: Neuroticism, depression, anxiety and age accounted for overall sleep quality. Further analyses revealed that different psychosocial and health-related factors such as pain, loneliness and personality accounted for scores in the different components. Conclusion: Interventions for poor sleep quality may depend on the aspect of sleep affected in the individual, and treatment may be contingent on a number of different psychosocial variables. Future research could focus on developing personalised treatment programs for older adults with sleep complaints. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8571186805
146,Happiness among community-dwelling older persons: Is it related to pain and loneliness?,"Given the global increase in the aging population, it is necessary to focus on psychological well-being among older persons in addition to maintaining physical health, thus enabling them to achieve healthy aging. Method: It was an exploratory cross-sectional design. Results: A total of 78 older adults (20 males and 58 females) from four community elderly centers were invited, with a mean age of 75.22. The mean happiness score was 7.44 ± 1.91. There were no significant differences in happiness in most of the demographic data; except relationship with family members and economic resources (p< 0.05). This showed that Chinese older persons with better family relationships and greater financial stability felt happier. Also, happiness was positively correlated with life satisfaction and social network and negatively correlated with loneliness and chronic pain. Conclusion: It is important to enhance the happiness and psychological well-being of older adults and allow them to enjoy their longevity in the community. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.2757265931
210,Growing old and lonely in different societies: Toward a comparative perspective,The main argument of this paper is that the subjective experience of loneliness among older people must be analyzed in relation to the overall value system of society or the subcultural values of particular segments of society. Cultural or subcultural value systems are contrasted in terms of whether they give priority to individualistic values or to collective values such as family or community bonds. These differences in value systems result in important differences in people's social contacts and socioemotional bonding experiences as well as their level of satisfaction with a given level of social relationships. It is suggested that these differences must be looked at in relation to basic human needs for social bonding as well as needs for individuation. The concept of the loneliness threshold is introduced to identify the level of social contacts that individuals desire to avoid the experience of loneliness or emotional isolation. © 1987 D.

280,Elderly mental health: Needs,"This paper highlights the mental health needs of the elderly. It tackles the issues of their institutionalisation and community care. Rapid urbanisation in Indian society throws up special problems in elderly care. There is great evidence of a raise in morbidity, mortality, hospitalisation and loss of functional status related to common mental disorders in the elderly patients. Overlap of depression and anxiety is very common with up to almost half of the elderly patients reporting significant depressive and anxiety symptoms. Also, depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in late life. Growth in the elderly population means a direct increase in age related diseases such as dementia and poor mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, suicide and serious constraints on the quality of life among elderly individuals. The need to identify new and unmet problem areas and develop efficient therapeutic outcomes for this special population is stressed.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.7122434114

These problems can range from locating financial support to purchasing glasses or hearing aids to obtaining in-home training and devices that will make it possible for the individual with a sensory disability to continue living independently. Meeting the needs of these people requires that professionals be able to recognize sensory losses, accommodate for them, and help older adults to understand and cope with them.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.5350511073
185,The social relations of the elderly,"The aim of the study was to investigate the social life of the elderly, their level of satisfaction with friendships and their opinions on loneliness and their ability to be alone in old age. A cognitive deterioration test was administered to 956 self-sufficient elderly people. This was a scale to assess their perception of loneliness and a questionnaire on their opinion of loneliness. From the descriptive analyses and comparison with the average results, it appears that elderly people are fairly satisfied with their social life and they believe that loneliness can condition the quality of life and the ability to be alone. The research also revealed that environmental characteristics and social integration are important for achieving a satisfactory lifestyle. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

293,Why do i always feel tired Evaluating older patients reporting fatigue,"Fatigue is a common symptom in elderly persons, but it is often ignored as many patients and healthcare providers assume it is a natural progression of aging or may mistake it for somnolence, dyspnea, or muscle weakness. Since its importance is often underestimated, patients with fatigue may not receive an intervention, potentially resulting in significant functional decline. This article discusses the importance of identifying the underlying etiology or etiologies of a patient's fatigue so that it can be eliminated, if possible, or managed appropriately. History-taking, including consideration of the patient's symptom severity, is the most important part of evaluating fatigue. The authors present an algorithm that can be used to help identify the cause of a patient's fatigue.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6450206908

Stat., Bulletin 808, July 1976",Study evaluates the impact of selected aspects of a congregate meal program on the health status of the elderly at one rural and one urban site in Arkansas. Data were gathered from interviews with 50 participants and 50 nonparticipants at each site in June-July 1975. Findings show participants sampled spent less time in bed due to illness than nonparticipants (15 days versus 29 days). Also rural participants sampled who had been hospitalized spent an average of 10 nights during the year while rural nonparticipants averaged 28 days of hospitalization. Respondents were unanimous in their praise of the hot meals program and all but one wanted to see it expanded. Ninety-one percent indicated they appreciated social interaction with others more than any other aspect of the program. The greatest single need expressed was to see more people participating. Most felt the program had done them some good physically and mentally. The main conclusion drawn from this pilot study is that congregate meal programs can provide an avenue for the elderly to avoid malnutrition and some of the associated hospitalization due to crisis conditions along with social isolation and its debilitating aspects.,0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.1229542161
243,Effects of perinatal exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on the emotional reactivity of the offspring: A longitudinal behavioral study in Wistar rats,"Rationale: The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in the control of emotionality and recent clinical findings have shown that heavy prenatal exposure to cannabis is significantly associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms in exposed children. However, the long-term neurobehavioral consequences of in utero exposure to low-moderate doses of cannabinoid compounds have never been investigated. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether perinatal exposure to moderate doses of the active constituent of cannabis, the CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), influences the emotional reactivity of rat offspring. Methods: Primiparous Wistar rats were treated during pregnancy and lactation with doses of THC equivalent to the current estimates of moderate cannabis consumption in humans (2.5-5 mg kg-1, per os, from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 9). The emotional reactivity of infant, adolescent, and adult offspring was investigated using the isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalization, social interaction, and elevated plus-maze tests, respectively. Results: Perinatal THC treatment did not affect parameters of reproduction; however, at the dose of 5 mg kg-1, it increased the number of ultrasounds emitted by rat pups removed from the nest, inhibited social interaction and play behavior in the adolescent offspring, and induced an anxiogenic-like profile in the adult offspring tested in the elevated plus-maze test. Conclusion: These results suggest that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the control of emotionality since early developmental stages. Thus, even moderate doses of cannabinoid compounds, when administered during the perinatal period, can have profound consequences for brain maturation, leading to long-lasting neurodevelopmental alterations. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9368999462
264,Pervasive computing technologies to continuously assess Alzheimer's disease progression and intervention efficacy,"Traditionally, assessment of functional and cognitive status of individuals with dementia occurs in brief clinic visits during which time clinicians extract a snapshot of recent changes in individuals' health. Conventionally, this is done using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies on patients' and caregivers' ability to accurately recall daily activity and trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline. Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies. © 2015 Lyons, Austin, Seelye, Petersen, Yeargers, Riley, Sharma, Mattek, Wild, Dodge and Kaye.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.4889376562
28,Retirees on facebook: Can online social networking enhance their health and wellness?,"An individual's social network has a strong impact on his or her mental and physical health. This is of particular consequence for senior citizens who are at greater risk of social isolation after retirement, due to loss of spouse, mobility issues, and recent emphasis on aging in place, i.e., in smart homes. Can online social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook help alleviate social isolation of aging alone by enabling seniors to maintain high-quality social interactions? How can we make senior-friendly design improvements to SNSs? A preliminary national survey (N=168) of adults over 55 revealed that for those who had joined an SNS, the primary motivation cited for signing up was persuasion by a friend or family member, while nonusers cited a strong lack of interest rather than a lack of knowledge or skill, with implications for theory and design of SNS technology for senior citizens.",0,0,"no intervention, no SI, survey",0,,,,,0.9205671396
340,Do older people who self-harm receive the hospital care they need?,"Although self-harm is most common in younger people in Britain, the risk of suicide subsequent to an initial act of self-harm is considerably greater in older age groups. Four characteristics have been shown to be associated with increased vulnerability in older people who self-harm: increased suicidal intent, physical illness, mental illness and social isolation. This paper is part of a broader analysis of all self-harm presentations to a British hospital accident and emergency department over a five-year period. It examines the prevalence of these vulnerability indicators in patients aged 65 or over, and considers whether greater vulnerability in older patients is reflected in their clinical management within the hospital and in community support planning on discharge. At the first presentation older patients (n=91) exhibited greater vulnerability than did younger patients (n=2,326). Despite this, we found no evidence that older self-harm patients were any more likely than younger patients to routinely receive either a psychosocial assessment from a member of staff with specialist mental health training, or community aftercare planning on discharge from the hospital. This study lends weight to recently published national guidelines recommending that all acts of self-harm in older people be regarded as evidence of serious suicidal intent at the outset. © Pavilion Publishing 2004.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.7400540902
268,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.2841800129
207,Social Isolation and Social Support: An Applied Perspective,"Considerable empirical evidence substantiates the importance of social networks and support to health and well-being among the elderly. But considerably more research is necessary before successful interventions can be more generally implemented to positively alter an elder's network. In this article, the authors discuss social supportand isolationfrom an appliedperspective. They have combined presentations originally made at a National Institute on Aging-sponsored symposium on applied gerontology held in August 1992. They make some general observations concerning the field of applied social relations in later life, describe the mental health aspects of these relations, list some fundamental principles and existing technology for this field, describe the use of a brief screening instrument for social isolation developed by one of the authors (Lubben), and explore varying domains of knowledge concerning elder soical relations. They conclude by outlining some areas that they see as requiring the attention of an applications perspective to social support and isolation m the near future. © 1994, Sage Publications.

244,"Isolation and the timing of mammary gland development, gonadarche, and ovarian senescence: Implications for mammary tumor burden","In this study of Norway rats, we hypothesized that lifelong psychosocial experiences, social isolation or group living, trigger different developmental trajectories in the ovarian system, contributing to predisease pathways for spontaneous mammary tumors. Epidemiological studies indicate that early puberty and delayed menopause are risk factors for breast cancer. To that end, we took a cross-sectional, prospective approach and examined the ovarian system at two developmental points, young adulthood and middle age. We assessed ovarian function at both points, as well as mammary gland development at puberty and mammary tumor burden in middle age. Social isolation dissociated two components of puberty; it accelerated maturation of ovarian function while it simultaneously delayed mammary tissue development thereby increasing the exposure of developing breast parenchyma to high levels of estrogen. By mid-life, socially isolated rats had greater tumor burden despite having entered estropause prematurely, demonstrating that isolation did not increase tumorigenesis by prolonging ovarian function. These findings are discussed in the context of facultative lifespan strategies for rats born at different times of year and those living in isolation or in a large burrow community. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3059262544

These challenges can include decreasing strength, reduced mental capacity, social isolation, and the development of chronic health conditions. My PhD research attempts to analyze the needs and challenges of older adults and review their attitudes and motivations towards physical activity (PA). Furthermore, I aim to investigate various approaches in the development of socially interactive fitness activity programs, with the goal of increasing positive lifestyle motivations and quality of life (QoL). This research defines a taxonomy of motivational and personality characteristics of older adults to engage in PA. Lastly, this dissertation proposes the development of an adaptive application that addresses fitness gamification from the motivational perspective of an older adult. This application will empower older adults to engage in PA as a means to gain freedom, mobility and social interdependence within their public spheres. © 2015 ACM.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.8558969583

296,Gender and polypharmacotherapy in the elderly: A clinical challenge,"Polypharmacotherapy is a major concern in the elderly and especially in older women after the age of 80. It results from the intake of prescription and non-prescription drugs, being often a problem of evidence-based therapy. Besides the fact that women live longer than men and outnumber them, reasons for polypharmacy in women are diverse and include a different attitude towards intake of drugs between men and women, the propensity of women to rather see a physician and talk about their problems, the load of family responsibility as women are the main caregivers within a family, the influence of physician sex on patient care, the level of education, social deprivation and self-rated health. Women are more often prescribed potentially inappropriate medication and more often become victims of adverse drug reactions. This is not only due to the number and quality of drugs prescribed but also to differences in pharmacokinetics and - dynamics which make them more vulnerable to drug exposure. Thus, inappropriate prescribing contributes to hospitalization, poor quality of life, costs, compliance issues and poor outcomes. More preclinical and clinical studies with elderly patients and especially elderly women are needed to study the underlying mechanisms of the pharmacologic differences and obtain more insight into the difference in risk between men and women. Attention to prescribing of medications, consistent review of medication lists, and reevaluation of indications and outcomes of prescribing are essential to ensure that drugs are used appropriately in elderly women, polypharmacy is minimized and safety for patients is maximized. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3467134259
306,Sedative load among community-dwelling people aged 75 years and older: A population-based study,"Background: Drugs with sedative properties are among the most widely used drugs in community-dwelling older people. Use of sedative drugs has been associated with falls and fractures, cognitive and memory impairment and impaired physical function among older people. The sedative load model has been developed to quantify the cumulative effect of taking multiple drugs with sedative properties. Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate factors associated with sedative load among community-dwelling older people, using data collected as part of the Finnish Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the Good Care of the Elderly (GeMS) study. Methods: The GeMS study was a randomized, comparative study that evaluated a model for geriatric assessment, care and rehabilitation using a study sample of 1000 persons aged ≥75 years who were living in Kuopio, Finland. Of these, 700 people consented to participate and were community-dwelling. Demographic, diagnostic and drug use data (both regular and when-required drugs) were elicited during nurse interviews. For the current analysis, sedative load was computed using a previously published model, in which drugs taken on a regular and when-required basis were classified into one of four groups according to their sedative potential. Group 1 included primary sedatives (sedative rating 2) and group 2 included drugs with sedation as a prominent side effect (sedative rating 1). Each participant's sedative load was calculated by summing the sedative ratings of group 1 and 2 drugs. Logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with sedative load. Results: Twenty-nine percent of participants (n = 205) had a sedative load of ≥1 (i.e. used one or more drugs with sedative properties), and 22% (n = 158) had a sedative load of ≥2 (i.e. used either one primary sedative or two drugs with sedation as a prominent adverse effect or preparations with a sedating component) when considering regularly used drugs. A sedative load of ≥2 that related to regularly used drugs was associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.65; 95% CI 1.02, 2.67), poor self-perceived health (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.25, 3.38), impaired instrumental activities of daily living [IADL] (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.18, 3.01) and often feeling lonely (OR 4.72; 95% CI 2.15, 10.40). The same factors remained significantly associated with a sedative load of ≥2 after drugs used on a when-required basis were included in the analyses. Conclusions: The advantages of the sedative load model were that it included drugs with sedative properties prescribed for somatic diseases, described cumulative exposure to drugs that exert sedative effects through multiple mechanisms in the CNS, and incorporated a sedative rating for each drug. In an older population, female sex, impaired IADL, poor self-perceived health, and loneliness were associated with higher sedative load. Clinicians should remain cognizant of these factors when reviewing drug regimens and targeting interventions to optimize sedative use. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

225,The role of the intermediate care team in detecting and responding to loneliness in older clients,"The intermediate care team supports patients in their own homes to manage complex needs. They are ideally placed in the community to identify older adults at risk of loneliness. However, little is known about how intermediate care team professionals perceive, detect or respond to loneliness in their clients. This study explores intermediate care team professionals' attitudes to loneliness in the context of perceived service priorities and their experiences of managing loneliness in their clients. Eight professionals (n=2 physiotherapists, n=3 occupational therapists, n=3 nurses) took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed thematically using framework analysis, applying the theory of planned behaviour as an interpretive framework. Intermediate care team professionals see loneliness as a significant issue for many of their older clients but a low priority for intermediate care team services. They believe that loneliness often goes undetected because it is difficult to measure objectively. Barriers to managing loneliness included high workloads, unsatisfactory referral systems and lack of close working with social care and independent sector services. Brief but reliable loneliness assessments into routine practice, receiving training on detecting and managing loneliness, and improving working relationships with social care and independent sector services were highlighted as strategies that could improve the detection and management of loneliness in intermediate care team clients. © 2016 MA Healthcare Ltd.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.07330867259
4,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01). Conclusions: Using the Internet may be beneficial for decreasing loneliness and increasing social contact among older adults in assisted and independent living communities.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.2491159524
68,Digital Inclusion for Older Adults based on Physical Activities: An Age Concern,"Nowadays, we are living in an interdependent and interconnected world during an age that is driven by technological progress. It has extraordinary potential to improve the quality of later life: creating social networks to tackle isolation and loneliness; transforming services to help people live independently at home for longer; empowering consumers; and enabling civil participation. In light of this, this poster aims to present the development process of a digital booklet for mobile devices-smartphones and tablets that illustrate the benefits of doing physical exercises for older adults aiming to improve life quality and minimizing digital exclusion. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.7677217365
275,Barriers to the adoption of cell phones for older people with impairments in the USA: Results from an expert review and field study,"This qualitative exploratory study examines the barriers to the adoption of off the shelf cellular telephones for older people with vision, hearing, or dexterity impairments. We include the full range of factors that influence phone acquisition, use, and retention. We explore the feasibility of providing individual support to overcome learning barriers. The first stage of the study is a review of the sales process, purchase experience, and handset features available for cell phones in the Berkeley and Oakland areas of California in mid 2007. As the industry is organized, physical accessibility cannot be separated from programmatic access and business practice. The ergonomic aspects of handset design are mediated by firmware and software that changes rapidly and varies by carrier. The US sales model for cell phones, where purchasers select a pricing plan or tariff and then a handset from a limited group, does not accommodate the needs of seniors with impairments who need low cost plans but handsets with specific groups of features, most of which are generally available, but not necessarily available on any one phone and almost never on entry level phones. It is difficult for consumers to obtain information prior to purchase about handset accessibility. Features that support access are often difficult to find in menus and difficult for seniors to use. In the second stage of the study we gave a group of twelve older people with impairments, ranging from 66-90 years of age, a cell phone, airtime, and individual support for a one-month period. The results show that older people with impairments are deterred from cell phone use as much by the confusing structure of the industry as by the lack of certain handset features. They too often sacrifice access for price. They can be supported to learn to use cell phones but further work is needed to determine the specific kinds of support needed and how this can best be delivered. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

100,Losing connections and receiving support to reconnect: experiences of frail older people within care programmes implemented in primary care settings,"Aims and objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether care provided in the care programmes matched the needs of older people. Background: Care programmes were implemented in primary-care settings in the Netherlands to identify frail older people and to prevent further deterioration of health. Design and methods: In total, 23 older people participated in in-depth interviews. Within this study, three older people participated as co-researchers; they gathered and analysed the data together with the academic researchers. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Two categories emerged from the data: 'Losing connections' and 'Receiving support to reconnect.' 'Losing connections' reflects the needs of older people and 'Receiving support to reconnect' reflects their experience and the appreciated aspects of the provided care. A relationship of trust with the practice nurse (PN) appeared to be an important aspect of care, as it fostered the sharing of feelings and issues other than physical or medical problems that could not be shared with the general practitioner. The PNs are experienced as connectors, who help to restore feelings of connectedness and older peoples' access to resources in the community. Conclusions: The relationship with the PN was experienced as valuable because of the feelings of 'connectedness' it created. Through this connectedness, older people could discuss feelings of loneliness, depression and frustration in receiving and acquiring the appropriate resources and services with the PNs. Furthermore, the relationship with the PN helped the older people to gain access to other health professionals and services. Implications for practice: The results imply that care for frail older people should include an awareness of the importance of the trusting relationship. Nurses can play a vital role in creating a trusting relationship and are able to bridge the gap between older people and other professionals and services. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.115721181
355,Development and validation of an indicator of support for community-residing older Canadians,"Lack of social support is an important risk factor for disability, psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment, institutionalization, and mortality. Social networks are also important for the caregiving and emotional support that elderly people need to allow them to function well in the community. This article details the development and validation of an index of the instrumental support available to older community residents in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA). Preliminary item review, internal consistency, and exploratory factor analysis were carried out on a random half of the sample. The second half of the sample was used for cross-validation; internal consistency, exploratory factor analysis, and item response theory analysis were carried out. The final scale had six items; alpha internal consistency was 0.76 and IRT reliability was 0.85. A one-factor solution was most easily interpretable. IRT analyses showed that the scale was homogeneous and that most items were highly discriminating. The instrumental support scale also had a high correlation with size of social network; it was related to marital status and gender, and predicted institutionalization between the two phases of the study.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1801939629
31,Japan: State of active ageing,"In terms of numbers, Japan is now the oldest nation in the world as its 65+ population passed the 20% level in October 2006. Today's senior citizens are expected to successfully fulfil their later years quality-wise. In 2007, members of the baby boomer generation are reaching their retirement age, now mandatory at 60, and businesses are said to be eagerly anticipating the huge new emerging potential of the ""silver market"". To cope with functional changes, robotics will play a key role. Toshiba is developing a new robot which can download recipes from the Internet and prepare meals. So, most household equipment in a future home will be closely networked with Information and Communication Technology to enhance quality of life for all. However, looking at reality, we have to face the issue of digital divide. ICT is now part of life, but it is a quite foreign culture for most senior citizens in Japan as many of them have never used - for instance - a typewriter. Two major solutions to this issue are being tested. One consists of class-room lessons organized by local authorities, computer businesses, NGOs, universities and other educational institutes, etc. Another is a certification system. The biggest challenge is to help older people to realize that ICT is a ""must"" for them to achieve active and healthy ageing. It is obvious that they will face mobility impairment as they age. Impaired mobility limits social contacts and has an important impact on quality of life. ICT can help them to avoid this social isolation. © 2009 The European Community and IOS Press.

362,Mental health problems in older adults with HIV referred to a psychological medicine unit,"Although HIV is still seen by many as a disease affecting younger adults, it is known that at least 11% of individuals with AIDS in Britain are over the age of 50. It is likely that this older age representation will continue and increase and whilst much is known about the psychological wellbeing of younger individuals with HIV, it is crucial that we consider the differing experiences and needs of older adults with the disease. Fifty-two adults with HIV over the age of 54 were referred to the Department of Psychological Medicine between June 1990 and December 1996. Data for these patients were compared with corresponding information for a random sample of younger patients with HIV. The older adults were found to differ significantly from the younger individuals on a variety of social, psychological and medical variables including social isolation, employment worries, sexuality, previous psychiatric history and stage of HIV at referral. It seems that current HIV services may actually alienate a significant proportion of potential users through not being sensitive to the needs and views of these older individuals. This must be addressed by policy makers and practitioners to ensure that psychiatric and psychological services become more acceptable and accessible to the older adult.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8003908694
57,User interface for social networking application for the elderly,Elderly people with no or limited skills of using computers are in risk of social isolation as social life moves to the Internet. This paper describes the design process and implementation of a user interface and device for the elderly for a social networking application. The idea is that people with no previous experience on using computers are able to use the device immediately and that the device is not considered to be a computer. An iterative and user-centred design process is used to ensure that all the needs and views from the users are taken into account. The user interface and the device have been tested in long lasting field trials and the results are presented in this paper. Based on the results the implemented device seems to qualify the needs of elder users. © 2013 ACM.,0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.514222301
196,Older people with depression: Pilot study,"Background. Although a substantial number of studies have identified the prevalence of depression experienced by older adults living in the community and the factors that may precipitate this depression, few have focussed on depression in older people who attend day centres. Consequently, there is no literature suggesting how depression in this population may be psychologically managed. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a pilot study investigating the incidence of depression in people attending a London Age Concern day centre, and its associations with perceptions of handicap, loneliness, social support networks, satisfaction with social support, and satisfaction with life. Methods. A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with attendees at a London Age Concern day centre between November 1998 and January 1999. The day centre manager selected a convenience sample of 24 of 156 participants. Inclusion criteria were that participants must attend the day centre regularly and be over or equal to 65 years of age. The exclusion criterion was known psychiatric illness. Participants were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy, which identifies caseness of psychopathology and includes a loneliness subscale, and completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Social Support Questionnaire and London Handicap Scale. Results. There was a higher level of depression in this day centre setting than that found in other community-based studies. There were the expected significant associations between depression and loneliness, and depression and satisfaction with life. However, unexpectedly, there were no associations between depression and social support, or depression and handicap. Conclusions. The study has several limitations. However, the high level of depression and significant relationships between depression, loneliness and satisfaction with life may indicate that the social function of day centres is not meeting expectations. This suggests that there could be a role for community mental health nurses in offering psychosocial interventions to alleviate some of the distress experienced.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.05353255136
98,Barriers to social participation among lonely older adults: The influence of social fears and identity,"Introduction: Loneliness among older adults is a major public health problem that may be associated with processes of social participation and identity. This study therefore sought to examine the relationship between social participation and identity in a sample of lonely older adults living independently in London, England. Method: An inductive qualitative approach, based on semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, was employed. Results: Participants commonly spoke of barriers to social participation that have been reported elsewhere, including illness/disability, loss of contact with friends/relatives, lack of a supportive community, and lack of acceptable social opportunities. However, novel findings were also derived. In particular, participants commonly minimised the difficulties they faced alone, and described attempts to avoid social opportunities. These behaviours were linked to fears about engaging in social participation opportunities, including fears of social rejection and/or exploitation, and fears of losing valued aspects of identity. Discussion: It is concluded that social participation amongst lonely older people will not improve through the removal of previously reported barriers alone; instead, older peoples' beliefs, fears and identities must be addressed. Suggestions for implementing these findings within community organisations are provided. © 2015 Goll et al.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.69643982
135,Social isolation in older Malaysians: Prevalence and risk factors,"Background:: Social isolation is one of the most important emerging issues among ageing populations, as it reduces well-being, health and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to identify prevalence and risk factors of social isolation in older Malaysians. Methods:: The sample for this study was drawn from a national survey entitled 'Patterns of Social Relationships and Psychological Well-Being among Older Persons in Peninsular Malaysia'. Social isolation was measured with the Lubben Social Network Scale. Results:: The findings from the present study showed that 49.8% of older Malaysians are at risk for social isolation. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of sons, number of brothers, number of sisters, household size, self-rated health, place of residence, homeownership, sex and ethnicity were significantly associated with social isolation. Conclusion:: These findings may have some implications for social and health-care policymakers in planning and developing new and effective interventions such as educational programmes to reduce social isolation among this vulnerable population. © 2013 The Authors.

151,A place for singing: Active music engagement by older Chinese Australians,"Positive, active engagement in community singing groups can provide emotional, social, cognitive and physical benefits to older participants. This article explores these benefits through the experiences of a group of older Chinese Australians still active in their local community. Using a qualitative, phenomenological case study approach, it draws on the participants' own understandings and experiences with singing and music. In settings such as this, language barriers can compound social isolation and loneliness in individuals, and may hamper studies of culturally and linguistically diverse older people. Thus, participants were interviewed in their first language, Mandarin Chinese. The data from these interviews were thematically analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), which explores how participants make sense of their personal and social world. Four broad themes were identified from the data: Emotional well-being, connections with the past, shared interests and mental and physical well-being. Each of these themes is explored in the article through the words and experiences of the participants. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Article.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5383407445

The importance of older adults' participation in cyberspace has increased as Internet use for commerce and communication has increased. The present study explores how older adults' Internet use affects their sense of community. An online survey was conducted at the University of Sydney to determine the associations between Internet use and seniors' sense of community and well-being. Participants were recruited online. There was a positive association between a sense of belonging to an online community, sense of community, and well-being. Seniors' use of the Internet for communication and information, and the frequency and history of their Internet use, were consistently related to a greater sense of community. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,1,no intervention,0,,,,,0.9240414317
279,Screening depression among elderly in a city of southeast Asia,"Introduction: Changing family structure (Joint to Nuclear), increased life expectancy above 60 years of age, generation and communication gap, financial dependency on children leads to conflict among family members. This may sometime lead to old age home settlement of elderly people. All these condition leads to isolation and insecurity among elderly people and this condition affect the mental status of elderly people which may sometime lead to depression among Old Age Homes residents and family living elderly people. Objective: To study the prevalence of depression and diagnosed systemic morbidities among elderly people. To study the predictors of depression among study subjects. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among elderly people (age ≥60 years) residing in old age homes (OAHs) and in community/families in Lucknow, India. Multistage sampling technique was used to include required sample of subjects from the community and for OAHs all the elderly people living in OAHs were included. Geriatric depression scale was used to screen depression. Results: Depression was 27.7% among elderly people residing in OAHs while it was 15.6% those residing at their own homes. In community most frequent morbidity was hypertension (17.7%) while 41.1% elderly people had no diagnosed morbidity. In OAHs out of total the musculoskeletal morbidity (33.7%) was most frequent and 18.8% had no diagnosed morbidity. On multivariate analysis financial dependency and education were found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: Depression was more common among elderly living in Old Age Homes as compare to those living in community. Hypertension, musculoskeletal morbidities and eye related morbidities were most frequent diagnosed morbidities.

147,Health status and wellbeing of older adults living in the community and in residential care settings: Are differences influenced by age?,"The objective is to identify the differences and the main factors influencing health status and wellbeing variables between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized older adults, as well as the interaction effect of institutionalization and age. Data on a total of 468 older adults from a national survey on noninstitutionalized and from a study on institutionalized older people were analyzed. Sociodemographic variables and measures on wellbeing (Personal Wellbeing Index, PWI), health status (EQ5D), functional ability (Barthel Index), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression ScaleDepression subscale), loneliness and comorbidity were used. Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine differences between groups and multiple regression analyses to identify factors associated to health and well-being were performed. Significant differences in health status variables, but not in wellbeing were detected between groups. Controlling for age, differences in health status (EQVAS) were found to be not significant in both groups. In the noninstitutionalized group, people aged 78 years or more reported a significantly lower wellbeing (PWI) than younger counterparts. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that depression, functional dependence, loneliness and sex were associated with health status; while depression, health status, loneliness and the interaction of ageinstitutionalization were related to wellbeing. The results suggest that age influences communitydwelling older adults wellbeing to a greater extent than it does to institutionalized older people. This finding has implications for resource allocation and interventions addressed to improve health and wellbeing in older adults. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.4441238347
33,Towards a practical framework for managing the risks of selecting technology to support independent living,"Information and communication technology applications can help increase the independence and quality of life of older people, or people with disabilities who live in their own homes. A risk management framework is proposed to assist in selecting applications that match the needs and wishes of particular individuals. Risk comprises two components: the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the consequences of that harm. In the home, the social and psychological harms are as important as the physical ones. The importance of the harm (e.g., injury) is conditioned by its consequences (e.g., distress, costly medical treatment). We identify six generic types of harm (including dependency, loneliness, fear and debt) and four generic consequences (including distress and loss of confidence in ability to live independently). The resultant client-centred framework offers a systematic basis for selecting and evaluating technology for independent living. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

73,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6327465659

This study sought to understand the experience of living and coping with nocturia, from the perspective of community-living older men and women. Method.Individual semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 32 older people with self-reported nocturia of twice nightly or more. Results. Four key characteristics of nocturia were identified. Nocturia was described as simultaneously debilitating, frustrating, distressing and puzzling. It impacted on sleep patterns and quality, personal relationships and increased the fear of falling among older people when rising to use the toilet at night. Previously unrecognised variability and unpredictability in the condition were highlighted features. Nocturia was not prioritised for health intervention. There were gender differences in initial help-seeking however once prostate disease was eliminated, self-management strategies to cope with the effects of nocturia were the norm. Conclusions. This study indicates that nocturia has a widespread and profound influence on older people's quality of life and participation, despite being regarded as a relatively benign condition by both older people and health professionals. Several features of the condition, which have the potential for great impact, are poorly recognised in particular its variability and unpredictability. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9451965925
127,A conceptual model for aging better together intentionally,"Social networks and improved health outcomes are strongly connected, yet many elders face isolation and loneliness. This article presents a study of an elder cohousing community in which residents are dealing with aging-related stresses as a group and creating positive outcomes for themselves. The article posits a conceptual model of how this phenomenon of ""aging better together intentionally"" occurs and the resulting benefits. QUESTIONS: What happens when elders choose to live together in a community in which they consciously address aging collectively? Is it possible to age better together intentionally? If so, what does it look like, under what circumstances does it blossom, and how does it improve the aging experience? METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 26 residents of an elder cohousing community in 2009. Respondents were white, mostly female, and averaged 73. years in age. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts led to a conceptual model of aging better together intentionally. To further explore the model, quantitative survey data were collected from the residents three years later. RESULTS: The framework of communal coping provided the mechanism of aging better together intentionally. Quantitative data supported the existence of mutual support, increased acceptance of aging, and feelings of safety/less worry/lessening of social isolation as benefits of this type of living arrangement. DISCUSSION: This research demonstrates the agency of older adults, the heterogeneity of the aging experience, and the value of older adults sharing their knowledge of the aging process with each other. Our conceptual model of aging better together intentionally could serve as a basis for interventions in other settings to provide a new way for people to age together with enhanced quality of life. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.01352846927
371,Sensory deprivation in geriatric patients,"Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall 'value system'. Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Reevaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5661415711
276,"The relationship between excessive internet use and depression: A questionnaire-based study of 1,319 young people and adults","Background: There is a growing awareness of a psychiatric construct that needs to be better defined and understood: Internet addiction (IA). Recently there has been much public concern over the relationship between Internet use and negative affect. This study explored the concept of IA and examined the relationship between addictive symptoms and depression. Sampling and Methods: An online questionnaire was used to measure participants' Internet use, the functions for which they used the Internet, and their depressive tendencies. Three scales were included: the IA Test, the Internet Function Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). 1,319 respondents completed the questionnaires, with 18 (1.2%) identified as falling in the IA category. Results: Correlational analyses were conducted across the whole data sample. In factorial analyses, the 18 IA respondents were compared to a matched group of non-addicted (NA) respondents in terms of their scores on the Function Test and the BDI. Across the whole data sample, there was a close relationship between IA tendencies and depression, such that IA respondents were more depressed; there were also significant differences between the sexes, with men showing more addictive tendencies than women. In addition, young people were significantly more likely to show addictive symptoms than were older people. There was a significant difference between the IA and the NA group in their levels of depressive symptoms, with the NA group firmly in the non-depressed range, and the IA group in the moderately-to-severely depressed range (F1, 34 = 22.35; p &lt; 0.001). In terms of the function for which they used the Internet, the IA group engaged significantly more than the NA group in sexually gratifying websites, gaming websites and online community/chat websites. Conclusions: The concept of IA is emerging as a construct that must be taken seriously. Moreover, it is linked to depression, such that those who regard themselves as dependent on the Internet report high levels of depressive symptoms. Those who show symptoms of IA are likely to engage proportionately more than the normal population in sites that serve as a replacement for real-life socialising. Further work needs to be done on validating this relationship. Future research is needed to corroborate the existing evidence and address the nature of the relationship between IA and depression: there is comorbidity between these conditions that needs greater investigation. © 2010 S.

172,Understanding loneliness in the lived experiences of Iranian elders,"Elderly people are especially vulnerable to loneliness. Loneliness as an important phenomenon is correlated with a variety of emotional, physical and health-related complications. However, a few studies have investigated the experience of loneliness from the perspectives of elderly people living in communities. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of Iranian elders of loneliness. A qualitative study using phenomenological approach was employed with four men and nine women living in their own houses. In-depth interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using hermeneutic methods. The emerged themes were 'an aversive emotional state', 'isolated from intimate relationships', 'being deprived from social and external support systems' and 'being abused and neglected'. Our study findings support the view that the experience of loneliness creates an aversive emotional state which is associated with negative and painful feelings. In addition, it was revealed that lack of access to intimate relationships and supportive systems as well as the experience of being abused and neglected were major factors contributing to the feelings of loneliness among Iranian elders. In terms of recommendation for practice, worldwide nurses are expected to be knowledgeable about the factors which increase feelings of loneliness. Alternatively, they should develop coping mechanisms among elders with the cooperation of their family members; also, attract community attention in order to improve social services in both quality and quantity. © 2010 The Authors.

Social isolation decreases the quality of life, affects health and acts against independent living, which is important for both the elderly and the society. Social networking can provide elderly a sense of presence with their ""safety-net"", that is, relatives, friends and healthcare personnel that counteract the effects ageing causes to their social connections. In this paper, the design of an advanced socially assistive networking system is presented which provides the elderly the opportunity to enforce their connectivity with their safety-net. Specifically, attention is given to the design of a core service platform managing all requests between elderly and their safety-net, and to the design of elderly home terminal as well as to the design of mobile and Web pervasive applications for the members of the safety-net. Moreover, a user-centered approach is presented for the design of the overall system where special emphasis is put on usability and HCI.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6085720381
380,The relation between social network site usage and loneliness and mental health in community-dwelling older adults,"Background Loneliness is expected to become an even bigger social problem in the upcoming decades, because of the growing number of older adults. It has been argued that the use of social network sites can aid in decreasing loneliness and improving mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how social network sites usage is related to loneliness and mental health in community-dwelling older adults. Method The study population included community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and over residing in the Netherlands (n=626) collected through the LISS panel (www.lissdata.nl). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses, adjusted for potentially important confounders, were conducted in order to investigate the relation between social network sites usage and (emotional and social) loneliness and mental health. Results More than half of the individuals (56.2%) reported to use social network sites at least several times per week. Social network sites usage appeared unrelated to loneliness in general, and to emotional and social loneliness in particular. Social network sites usage also appeared unrelated to mental health. Several significant associations between related factors and the outcomes at hand were detected. Conclusion In this sample, which was representative for the Dutch population, social network sites usage was unrelated to loneliness and/or mental health. The results indicate that a simple association between social network site usage and loneliness and mental health as such, cannot automatically be assumed in community-dwelling older adults.

86,A livinglab approach to involve elderly in the design of smart tv applications offering communication services,"Aging is a new step of life with a lot of changes that could be related with physical, cognitive and social frailties. Rather than addressing autonomy and dependency issues for which a variety of assistive technologies has been designed, our aim is to define how ICTs could alleviate elderly loneliness, in order to cope with their social frailty. We make the hypothesis that TV is a good medium for this purpose and we design Smart TV applications dedicated to foster the social interaction among elderly. We adopt a living lab approach, which assure us of an early engagement of the end-users. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.7515764108
59,A socialization intervention in remote health coaching for older adults in the home,"Previous studies have shown that social ties enhance both physical and mental health, and that social isolation has been linked to increased cognitive decline. As part of our cognitive training platform, we created a socialization intervention to address these issues. The intervention is designed to improve social contact time of older adults with remote family members and friends using a variety of technologies, including Web cameras, Skype software, email and phone. We used usability testing, surveys, interviews and system usage monitoring to develop design guidance for socialization protocols that were appropriate for older adults living independently in their homes. Our early results with this intervention show increased number of social contacts, total communication time (we measure email, phone, and Skype usage) and significant participant satisfaction with the intervention. © 2013 IEEE.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.5591861192
326,Age-related hearing loss,"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common neurosensory deficit associated with aging. It presents with a predictable pattern of sensorineural hearing loss, causing problems with communication that have been associated with depression and social isolation. Recent studies have improved our understanding of the etiology of ARHL on a molecular level. While treatment options exist with hearing aids and cochlear implants, prevention by identification and avoidance of key risk fadors remains the best strategy for dealing with this disease.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1602841847
169,Older home nursing patients' perception of social provisions and received care,"Social loneliness and isolation may be some of the consequences that older people experience regarding age-related changes and losses, and nurses should be engaged in identifying social networks and social needs in this group. The aims of this study were to describe perceived social provisions in a group of older home-dwelling care-dependent patients, and to explore the relationship between perceived social provisions, physical functioning, mental state and reception of formal and informal care. The sample consisted of 242 persons aged 75+ years from seven municipalities in southern Norway, all receiving home nursing. Data were collected by means of structured interviews. Social support was assessed using the revised Social Provisions Scale. Physical functioning was assessed using the Barthel Index, and mental state using questions about loneliness, depressive symptoms and anxiety. Types and frequencies of social network contacts and formal and informal care were registered. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U-tests, Cronbach's alpha coefficient and stepwise multiple regression were used in the analyses. In general, the level of perceived social provisions and togetherness in the study group was high, especially among women and the married. Decreased physical functioning and declined mental state were related to lower level of social provisions. The majority of the individuals had frequently contacts with several types of social networks, like friends, neighbours and religious communities, in addition to close family. Contact with these informal networks was found to be close related to perceived social support and togetherness. Reduced social provisions was related to increased amount of home nursing, which could indicate that demand for home care may work as a strategy to gain social contact. In this sense, dependence in daily life functioning could possibly contribute to social contact rather than reduce it. © 2010 The Authors.

194,Cultivating health': Therapeutic landscapes and older people in northern England,"While gardening is seen, essentially, as a leisure activity it has also been suggested that the cultivation of a garden plot offers a simple way of harnessing the healing power of nature (The therapeutic garden, Bantam Press, London, 2000). One implication of this is that gardens and gardening activity may offer a key site of comfort and a vital opportunity for an individual's emotional, physical and spiritual renewal. Understanding the extent to which this supposition may be grounded in evidence underpins this paper. In particular, we examine how communal gardening activity on allotments might contribute to the maintenance of health and well being amongst older people. Drawing on recently completed research in northern England, we examine firstly the importance of the wider landscape and the domestic garden in the lives of older people. We then turn our attention to gardening activity on allotments. Based on the findings of our study, we illustrate the sense of achievement, satisfaction and aesthetic pleasure that older people can gain from their gardening activity. However, while older people continue to enjoy the pursuit of gardening, the physical shortcomings attached to the aging process means they may increasingly require support to do so. Communal gardening on allotment sites, we maintain, creates inclusionary spaces in which older people benefit from gardening activity in a mutually supportive environment that combats social isolation and contributes to the development of their social networks. By enhancing the quality of life and emotional well being of older people, we maintain that communal gardening sites offer one practical way in which it may be possible to develop a 'therapeutic landscape'. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

283,CASPER plus (CollAborative care in Screen-Positive EldeRs with major depressive disorder): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Depression accounts for the greatest disease burden of all mental health disorders, contributes heavily to healthcare costs, and by 2020 is set to become the second largest cause of global disability. Although 10% to 16% of people aged 65years and over are likely to experience depressive symptoms, the condition is under-diagnosed and often inadequately treated in primary care. Later-life depression is associated with chronic illness and disability, cognitive impairment and social isolation. With a progressively ageing population it becomes increasingly important to refine strategies to identity and manage depression in older people. Currently, management may be limited to the prescription of antidepressants where there may be poor concordance; older people may lack awareness of psychosocial interventions and general practitioners may neglect to offer this treatment option. Methods/design: CASPER Plus is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care intervention for individuals aged 65years and over experiencing moderate to severe depression. Selected practices in the North of England identify potentially eligible patients and invite them to participate in the study. A diagnostic interview is carried out and participants with major depressive disorder are randomised to either collaborative care or usual care. The recruitment target is 450 participants. Discussion: Results will add to existing evidence and a positive outcome may lead to the commissioning of this model of service in primary care.

25,Ambient communication and sense of presence device,"The number of elderly people is increasing rapidly both in absolute numbers and in relation to younger population. It is the benefit for both the elders and the communities that elderly people continue to live in their own homes as long as possible. Therefore technology should be used to help the elders in their homes. As loneliness and social isolation have negative impact on the health and happiness of the older population, ambient devices and social networking may be used to help the elderly connect with their friends and families. In this paper we will demonstrate our solution, the Amcosop system, which will help elders feel safe and keep connected with their nearest and dearest. © 2010 ACM.",0,0,"no intervention, no SI, protocol",0,,,,,0.9035680219
257,Adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly Patients: Usefil web services addressing this challenge,"USEFIL is proposing an integrated system which will cope with ageing problem providing advanced, affordable and unobtrusive monitoring and web communication solutions for seniors living independently. Older adults face many challenges to their independence, often related to feeling loneliness, to a decline in mobility or cognition causing for example unintentional medication non-adherence. The ""adherence USEFIL system"" provides efficient and effective means of increased adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly patients and thus extends the time that older people can live independently in their homes while limiting increases in public expenditure. This paper describes the design process of the services and apps of the ""adherence USEFIL system"". Aim of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design an ICT solution for increasing adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly people. More specifically using the theoretical lens of the Design Science Research Methodology theory the paper presents the necessary steps that have been conducted to design the ""adherence USEFIL system"". Results demonstrate that the exploitation of 'off-the-shelf' consumer devices readily succeeds in meeting the study's initial objectives. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.7419270399
350,Why elder abuse continues to elude the health care system,"Elderly men and women of all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds are vulnerable to mistreatment, and most often it goes undetected. For many elderly victims of abuse, the hospital is the only potential site for outside contact and support. An elder abuse program has been created at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, and funding was granted to assist victims with compensation claims; provide counsel and advocacy for victims; and provide support via ongoing telephone contact and referrals to community agencies. Simultaneously, hospital-wide educational seminars and rounds have provided the staff and students with information concerning detection of abuse and neglect. Over a 2-year period, 182 cases were identified and assessed. More than 50% of these cases involved patients with a diagnosis of memory impairment. Five percent of the cases involved a long history of domestic violence. In most cases a family member was identified as the abuser, and in a majority of instances the victim either denied the suspected abuse or tried to rationalize the behavior of the abuser. Patients were afraid of reporting abuse or changing their situation, despite being informed of possible resources. To combat this escalating problem in our growing elderly population, interdisciplinary collaboration between physicians and social workers is often crucial. Communication via the medical record can be key to monitoring patients in the community. There also needs to be ongoing education of all hospital staff in an effort to continually heighten awareness of this problem.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.7887351818
125,Deafblind UK expands operations in Northern Ireland to further reduce isolation and enhance the lives of older deafblind people,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the need for services catering for older deafblind people in Northern Ireland (NI) and how Deafblind UK is responding, supported by funding from the Big Lottery Fund. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is designed to provide an overview of deafblindness in NI. Supported by research and case studies, it explains the current situation, highlights the issues of this disability, the unique response required and how Deafblind UK's Connections NI project is meeting these needs. Findings - Older deafblind people are a highly vulnerable group yet there was a severe lack of services in the region catering for their specific needs. Based on work elsewhere in the UK and initial feedback, Deafblind UK's Connections NI project has been designed to support older deafblind people in the region to give them control over their life choices and retain independence as far as possible. Research limitations/implications - The project was only launched in April 2013 so although results have been achieved by Deafblind UK elsewhere in the country, it could take some time for similar results to be seen in NI, particularly when considering the nature of the work. Practical implications - Deafblind UK will work alongside agencies and in the community to raise awareness of deafblindness, helping to create clearer classification of the disability and associated issues, and deliver more targeted services that reach a higher proportion of older deafblind people in the region. Originality/value - This paper highlights the lack of services for older deafblind people in NI and how Deafblind UK is uniquely meeting these needs. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

346,Marginality among older injectors in today's illicit drug culture: Assessing the impact of ageing,"Aims: As conceptualized by Robert Park in 1928, the 'marginal man' occupies simultaneously an intermediate point between two distinct cultures that embody some level of contradictory normative expectations, behaviors and beliefs. This paper explores the influence of ageing and social change on the creation of marginality among injection drug users over age 50 who have been chronic heroin users since their youth. Design: Our data are drawn from in-depth interviews with 40 (28 male and 12 female) not-in-drug-treatment, active injecting drug users between the ages of 18 and 68. Setting: Our sample was recruited using street outreach as part of a larger, community-based study conducted from a converted storefront in a high crime, economically depressed neighborhood on the west side of Chicago. Findings: As they aged, and under the pressures of social change, the older users whom we studied moved from center positioning in the illicit drug culture of their youth to the margins of a differing drug culture of today where they participate largely unseen by others. Nostalgic for the 'Old School' mores of the past, and unable to transcend or assimilate fully into the cultural practices and norms of the 'New', they respond to their predicament by embracing 'poise' in the face of loneliness, stress and fear of victimization. Conclusions: Our respondents' experiences draw attention to the need to refine the field's theoretical and practical understandings of what it means to be marginal and its consequences for older drug users and people in general. The results also point to what happens when society changes but some of its members do not.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4392466297
143,Relationship between depression and loneliness in elderly and examination of influential factors,"This study was planned and conducted for the purpose of examining the relationship between depression and loneliness in elderly people and the influencing factors. The study was a descriptive and correlational study and its population consisted of 17,080 older individuals aged sixty and over who were registered at six Family Healthcare Centers (FHCs) located in the provisional center of Malatya. The sample of the study comprised of 913 elderly people who were chosen from the elderly people registered at the FHCs first by cluster sampling and then by simple random sampling from the clusters in proportion to the population. The data was collected between April and June 2011 using a questionnaire developed by the investigators in line with the literature, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS). They had a mean score of 13.83 ± 7.4 from the GDS and 40.50 ± 12.1 from the ULS. A positive correlation was found between Geriatric Depression and loneliness (r= 0.608, p< 0.001). It was observed that there was a significant correlation between loneliness and depression in the elderly people living in a community, presence of social security and higher income, on the other hand, led to lower mean scores. In view of these results, it can be advised that a minimum income should be secured for elderly people whether they have social security or not, their families and the society should be trained not to leave elderly people alone. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7176954788
332,Time since falling and fear of falling among community-dwelling elderly,"Background: A fall experienced by an elderly person is of special note because it appears to hold a reciprocal causal association with the fear of falling. This study attempts to determine the temporal relationship between the fear of falling and falling among community-dwelling elderly. Methods: Data on falls experienced during the previous three years were obtained from 732 community-dwelling elderly people. Participants were also asked to provide detailed information about their most recent fall, including the date, time of day, place, circumstances, consequences of the fall, fear of falling, and activity limitations due to fear of falling. Results: Those who had fallen within the past six months had over four times greater odds of a fear of falling and approximately five times greater odds of activity restriction, compared with those who had not fallen. The association decreased linearly over time, and became nonsignificant for those who had not fallen during the past 25-36 months. Conclusions: The experience of a fall is strongly associated with an increased fear of falling, and the association appears to persist for at least two years. An elderly person who has experienced a fall requires continuous attention to prevent the development of fear as another problem, together with early intervention to counter the fear of falling. © 2007 International Psychogeriatric Association.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6962397606
284,Current and emerging treatment options for the elderly patient with chronic kidney disease,"The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people. There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age groups. © 2014 Fassett.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4245139472

Currently technology for the home is limited to sensor based systems that are supposed to support activities of daily living but omit emotional needs from the design requirements (Down 2005). This paper describes the work of the authors in developing an informal communication tablet computer based tool that is designed to decrease isolation and loneliness. We describe the person-centred design process of the technology and overview the process of developing CATCH a checklist to support the design of assistive technology systems.

The study was conducted on 85-year-old residents in Linköping municipality, Sweden. The data collected included medical records, health care utilization during the preceding 12 months and a postal questionnaire on assistance, assistive technology, functional impairment, feelings of loneliness, worries and health-related quality of life measured by the EQ-5D. Out of 650 eligible individuals, 496 (78% of those alive) participated. Despite the prevalence of multi-morbidity (68%) and mental discomfort, the majority managed self-care (85%), usual activities (74%) and had high (>60/100) self-rated health evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS). The non-hospitalized group reported a better health status than the hospitalized group in terms of medical aspects, living conditions and subjective estimation. Factors associated with in-patient care were an increased number of general practitioner visits, more assistive technology, community assistance, multimorbidity and/or diagnosed congestive heart failure and arrhythmia. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.615481898

Many women do not seek medical help and advice as they consider it to be an inevitable part of ageing. It can have significant impact on sufferers' lives and can contribute to an increased risk of falls, reduced quality of life, social isolation and depression. It is also known to be hugely underreported as patients are often too embarrassed to discuss their symptoms with members of their family or health professionals. OAB syndrome can however, be treated effectively in primary care with conservative, nurse-led treatments. This article will discuss the causes, implications, assessment and conservative treatments available to women over 65 years old presenting with OAB syndrome in primary care.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4111086491
10,Escape loneliness by going digital: A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a Dutch experiment in using ECT to overcome loneliness among older adults,"Background: This study evaluates the outcomes of an Internet-at-home intervention experiment that intended to decrease loneliness among chronically ill and physically handicapped older adults through introducing them to the use of an electronic communication facility. Method: To determine the effectiveness of the experiment in terms of reducing loneliness, 15 older adults were interviewed three times: shortly before the start, two years later and immediately after termination of the experiment, while their loneliness scores at zero and post-measurement were compared with those of a control group. Results: Both the participants and the control persons experienced a reduction in loneliness over time. However, the reduction was only significant for the intervention participants. Moreover, the changes in loneliness were significantly greater among the participants compared to the control persons. When looking more in detail, the effect of the experiment was only significant regarding emotional loneliness and among the highest educated. Findings of the qualitative research enabled us to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention helped alleviate loneliness. E-mail was found to facilitate social contact. Furthermore, the computer and Internet were often used to pass the time, taking people's minds off their loneliness. Unexpectedly, the intervention also improved people's self-confidence. Conclusion: The decline in loneliness is likely to be greater if persons under more favorable circumstances are selected and if more social functions of the Internet are used. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.7215242292
253,A review of new insights on the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline in ageing [Ipoacusia e declino cognitivo: Revisione della letteratura],"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has a multifactorial pathogenesis and it is an inevitable hearing impairment associated with reduction of communicative skills related to ageing. Increasing evidence has linked ARHL to more rapid progression of cognitive decline and incidental dementia. Many aspects of daily living of elderly people have been associated to hearing abilities, showing that hearing loss (HL) affects the quality of life, social relationships, motor skills, psychological aspects and function and morphology in specific brain areas. Epidemiological and clinical studies confirm the assumption of a relationship between these conditions. However, the mechanisms are still unclear and are reviewed herein. Long-term hearing deprivation of auditory inputs can impact cognitive performance by decreasing the quality of communication leading to social isolation and depression and facilitate dementia. On the contrary, the limited cognitive skills may reduce the cognitive resources available for auditory perception, increasing the effects of HL. In addition, hearing loss and cognitive decline may reflect a ‘common cause’ on the auditory pathway and brain. In fact, some pathogenetic factors are recongised in common microvascular disease factors such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension. Interdisciplinary efforts to investigate and address HL in the context of brain and cognitive ageing are needed. Surprisingly, few studies have been adressed on the effectiveness of hearing aids in changing the natural history of cognitive decline. Effective interventions with hearing aids or cochlear implant may improve social and emotional function, communication, cognitive function and positively impact quality of life. The aim of this review is to overview new insights on this challenging topic and provide new ideas for future research. © 2016, Pacini Editore S.p.A.

Social Support Instrument Reliability in Studying Older Lesbians,"We know little about the support needs and health of older lesbians because participant sexual identity has typically not been identified in aging studies. The Lubben Social Network Scale, Revised (LSNS-R) is found widely reliable for testing perceived social support among elders but has never been tested with an exclusively lesbian population. This pilot tested the instrument with an exclusively lesbian population in the Midwest.

It was also related, however, to fears, expectations, and personality characteristics likely to inhibit the restoration of personal support networks after a stressful life event such as widowhood. Finally, loneliness was associated with maladaptive behavior patterns such as failure to: plan for old age, engage in rehearsal for widowhood, engage in social comparison, or learn about available community health and social services.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3858276005
182,Predictors of perceived togetherness in very old men and women: A 5-year follow-up study,"Although a considerable amount of research has been carried out on older adults' social ties, most of it has focused on quantitative aspects and on cross-sectional samples. In this study, the subjective aspect of social interaction is described by the concept of perceived togetherness. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which different factors predict perceived togetherness in men and women over a 5-year period. It also addresses the question of whether it is possible to identify different subgroups in perceived togetherness. The data were collected with structured interviews and laboratory tests from 225 elderly people at ages 80 and 85. The results showed that the predictors of perceived togetherness partly differed between sexes as well as within the groups of males and females. Predictors common to both genders were contacts with friends, less depressive symptoms, higher education level and better coping with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The findings indicated the importance of friends. Widowhood and self-rated health were predictors in women but not in men. Moreover, there appeared to be two subgroups of women and men in perceived togetherness; these were labeled ""socially embedded"", ""socially isolated"", ""socially active"" and ""solitary"". The results indicate diversity in perceived togetherness and its predictors. More attention should be paid to individual differences in order to prevent loneliness and to promote older adults' well-being. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHOD: Following a exploration of quantitative methodologies, a qualitative approach was decided on. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants in a local patients' club. RESULTS: The analysis suggests that the stays in hospital were times of inactivity. In addition, social interaction was restricted by a combination of physical factors and the perception of a lack of staff time. The patients' club was identified as a stimulating and motivating force during the stay. However, it appeared to promote activity rather than social interaction. CONCLUSION: The patients' club was clearly beneficial to those who attended. However, while it filled the day, it did not address the issue of the limited social interaction that was the experience of the participants during their stay in hospital.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3897035215
72,PRISM development: Iterative design using human factors tools,"Purpose: We conducted a field trial to assess the relative benefits of: (i) a computer system referred to as PRISM (Personal Reminder Information and Social Management) versus (ii) a paper-based system containing comparable information (e.g., community information, educational resources, games). To evaluate the differential effects, we had to ensure that both systems were usable by and useful for the target users (i.e., older adults at risk for social isolation). In addition, the instructions for use and the training had to be clear and effective. To that end, we employed a human factors approach to the development of the PRISM system. Human factors practitioners investigate the capabilities and limitations of people and the demands placed on them when they interact with a system. Method: Our approach was multifaceted: (i) needs assessment with target users - we conducted a survey of older adults with computer experience to determine how they used a computer and the internet; (ii) we interviewed older adults who lack computer experience to assess their needs and interest in PRISM; (iii) we identified a prototype system to use as the starting point for PRISM and conducted a heuristic evaluation and cognitive walk-through by experts; (iv) we conducted detailed user testing of all experimental materials; and (v) we developed and tested a detailed instruction and support system. Results & Discussion: The survey and interviews yielded content ideas and challenges to be met in the design of the system. The evaluation by experts and target users identified user needs and design recommendations that were implemented in the redesign (e.g., meaningful icons and labels, navigation demands). The need for extensive training and instructional support became clear through the development and testing process, and thus these materials were integral to the implementation process. Overall, these data illustrate how human factors assessment tools provided valuable insights for design of the field trial, a necessary first step to ensure reliable and valid behavioral assessments.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6220947518
316,The impact of epidemic outbreak: The case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and suicide among older adults in Hong Kong,"Background: Previous studies revealed that there was a significant increase in suicide deaths among those aged 65 and over in 2003. The peak coincided with the majority of SARS cases being reported in April 2003. Aims: In this paper we examine the mechanism of how the SARS outbreak resulted in a higher completed suicide rate especially among older adults in Hong Kong. Methods: We used Qualitative data analysis to uncover the association between the occurrence of SARS and older adult suicide. Furthermore, we used a qualitative study based on the Coroner Court reports to provide empirical evidence about the relationship between SARS and the excessive number of suicide deaths among the elderly. Results: SARS-related older adult suicide victims were more likely to be afraid of contracting the disease and had fears of disconnection. The suicide motives among SARS-related suicide deaths were more closely associated with stress over fears of being a burden to their families during the negative impact of the epidemic. Social disengagement, mental stress, and anxiety at the time of the SARS epidemic among a certain group of older adults resulted in an exceptionally high rate of suicide deaths. Conclusions: We recommend that the mental and psychological well-being of the community, in particular older adults, be taken into careful account when developing epidemic control measures to combat the future outbreak of diseases in the community. In addition, it is important to alert family members to vulnerable individuals who are at potential risk because of their illnesses or anxieties. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3429418287
381,Social media gerontology: Understanding social media usage among older adults,"The percentage of older adults using social media has increased substantially in recent years, yet little research has been done to understand the foundations underlying social media technology usage by older adults. Such an understanding is useful for developing intelligent user modeling and personalization techniques specific to this growing community. The current work first compared characteristics of Facebook users to non-users among adults age 51 to 91 and found that older adult Facebook users were significantly more satisfied with their current social roles than non-users. Second, we explored several characteristics of active older adult Facebook users, providing detailed data regarding the ways in which they access social media, the kinds of personal information they typically share, and information about their public versus private communication practices, preferences, and concerns. Finally, we examined specific relationships between older adults' Facebook communication habits and their attitudes regarding perceived loneliness and social role satisfaction. Controlling for factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (education and income), and marital status,we found that directed communications (as opposed to broadcast communications or passive consumption of content) was correlated with reduced loneliness as well as increased social role satisfaction among this distinct population. © 2015 IOS Press and the authors.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.2371527328
177,"Social disconnectedness, perceived isolation, and health among older adults","Previous research has identified a wide range of indicators of social isolation that pose health risks, including living alone, having a small social network, infrequent participation in social activities, and feelings of loneliness. However, multiple forms of isolation are rarely studied together, making it difficult to determine which aspects of isolation are most deleterious for health. Using population-based data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we combine multiple indicators of social isolation into scales assessing social disconnectedness (e.g., small social network, infrequent participation in social activities) and perceived isolation (e.g., loneliness, perceived lack of social support). We examine the extent to which social disconnectedness and perceived isolation have distinct associations with physical and mental health among older adults. Results indicate that social disconnectedness and perceived isolation are independently associated with lower levels of self-rated physical health. However, the association between disconnectedness and mental health may operate through the strong relationship between perceived isolation and mental health. We conclude that health researchers need to consider social disconnectedness and perceived isolation simultaneously.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.14790431
145,Promoting the mental well-being of older people from black and minority ethnic communities in United Kingdom rural areas: Findings from an interview study,"Drawing from 81 interviews with practitioners in social care and housing with care services in the United Kingdom, this paper explores practice issues in rural areas when supporting the mental health and well-being of older people from Black and minority ethnic groups. The paper begins with a review of the literature which provides evidence that BME older people are likely to be increasingly part of the populations of rural areas. Next it presents interview data revealing that while practitioners are aware of such demographic changes in general terms; some feel that they lack training and skills in adapting their professional practice to support all older people. Others express feelings of professional isolation in seeking to support older people from minority groups and are concerned that older people from minority groups may be at risk of isolation and loneliness. The paper concludes with a discussion of the study's implications for rural practice, policy and research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.559999932
46,Easisocial: An innovative way of increasing adoption of social media in older people,"Online Social Networking has become one of the biggest successes of the Internet. Facebook is the most popular service with over 1.23 billion users. Online Social Networks have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. Nevertheless, many older people do not use online social networks given the barriers resulting from a lack of understanding and perceived usefulness. This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50–80 years old) do not use social media. Findings demonstrated that EasiSocial was statistically easier to learn and easier to use than Facebook and therefore potentially helpful to increase the adoption of Social Media technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.8021949501

144,"Social Participation, Social Environment and Death Ideations in Later Life","Objective: Few studies on elders' suicide and depression have integrated social and community factors in their explicative models. Most of the studied variables used are focused on individual and based on psychopathological models. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of socio-environmental factors on death ideations, using data from the European SHARE cohort. Method: Social support components and death ideations have been studied, together with known individual risk factors, within a sample of 11,425 European participants in the SHARE study, aged over 64. The item evaluating death ideations was extracted from the EURO-D12 questionnaire. Results: The high prevalence of death ideations (6.9% for men and 13.0% for women) confirmed that elders' death ideations, as it is known to be linked to suicidal behaviors, is a major public health issue. Bivariate analyses revealed a strong association between community participation and death ideations. This association was no longer significant while adjusting for depressive symptomatology. The logistic model identified that factors significantly associated with death ideations, when adjusted for the other factors were: having multiple depressive symptoms (OR = 1.64 per symptom) being aged, especially over 84 (OR = 1.58), being retired for fewer than five years (OR = 1.46), being widowed (OR = 1.35) and having a long-term illness (OR = 1.28). Conclusions: Although social and community participation is associated to death ideations, this link becomes non-significant in a regression model taking into account other factors. It is important to notice that depressive symptoms, which are obviously closely related to death ideations, take the greatest part in the association among all associated factors. Our results suggest that, consistently with the literature, while addressing death ideation or suicide prevention, professionals have to consider first the secondary prevention of depressive symptomatology. Strategies targeting social isolation and community participation should be considered as part of primary prevention policies. © 2012 Saïas et al.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3957860773
259,Exploring risk profiles and emergency frequency of purchasers and non-purchasers of personal emergency alarms: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Personal alarms support independent living and have the potential to reduce serious consequences after a fall or during a medical emergency. While some Australian states have government funded personal alarm programs, others do not; but user-pays services are available. Although several studies have examined the profiles of alarm users, little is known about the risk profile of non-users. Specifically, whether there are ""at risk"" individuals who are unable, or choose not to purchase a service, who experience a home-based emergency in which an alarm could have mitigated an adverse outcome. This study aimed to describe the 'risk profile' of purchasers and non-purchasers of alarms; explore the reasons behind the decision to purchase or not to purchase and identify how often emergency assistance was needed and why. Methods: Purchasers and non-purchasers were followed for one year in this prospective cohort study. Demographic, decision-making and risk factor data were collected at an initial face-to-face interview, while information about emergencies was collected by monthly calls. Results: One hundred and fifty-seven purchasers and sixty-five non-purchasers completed the study. The risk profiles between the groups were similar in terms of gender, living arrangements, fall history and medical conditions. Purchasers (Mean = 82.6 years) were significantly older than non-purchasers (Mean = 79.3 years), (t(220) = -3.38, p = 0.000) and more functionally dependent on the IADL (z = -2.57, p = 0.010) and ADL (z = -2.45 p = 0.014) function scores. Non-purchasers (Mean = 8.04, SD = 3.57) were more socially isolated with significantly fewer family networks than purchasers (Mean = 9.46, SD = 3.25) (t(220) = -2.86, p = 0.005). Both groups experienced similarly high numbers of emergencies, 38.2 % of purchasers and 41.5 % of non-purchasers had at least one emergency where an alarm could have assisted. Main reasons for non-purchase were: cost (77 %), limited alarm range (51 %), no need (39 %) and lack of suitable contacts (30 %). Conclusion: There are older individuals who are at high risk of an emergency who are choosing, often for financial and lack of family support reasons, not to purchase a personal alarm service. Greater availability of government funded subsidy schemes would enable these individuals to access a service. Increasing the range over which alarms work could increase their appeal to a broader range of older persons living in the community. Future research should consider how strategies that improve social isolation from family and challenge clients' beliefs about their own health and independence can support increased access to personal alarm services. © 2015 De San Miguel et al.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.6246735809
201,Intermediates' satisfaction with a loneliness intervention program aimed at older adults: Linkage of program plans and users' needs,"Intermediates' satisfaction with linkage of program plans and users' needs in the Dutch loneliness intervention program in good company (IGC) was studied. IGC was aimed at prevention and diminishment of loneliness in older adults, aged 55 years and above. Moreover, the objective was to improve helping and cooperation skills of intermediates, i.e. professional workers and volunteers. Different linkage approaches were used successively in three neighbourhoods, varying from top down instrumental to bottom up democratic linkage strategies. The intermediates' satisfaction with these strategies was measured using postal questionnaires, sent about 20 months after the introduction of the program to the three neighbourhoods. Satisfaction was significantly related to the intermediates' subjective evaluation of the linkage approach. Satisfaction was highest in the neighbourhood where the intermediates were consulted most explicitly and where they had a clear voice in the design and organisation of the intervention, using democratic linkage strategies. Satisfaction was clearly associated with the program's success in meeting targets aimed at intermediates. A relationship with effective prevention of loneliness in older adults was not found. It is concluded that the use of democratic linkage strategies, like needs assessments, local action plans and two-way communication between program designers and users, is essential for successful dissemination of health promotion activities.

344,"Prevalence, correlates and recognition of depression in the oldest old: The Leiden 85-plus study","Background: Various studies support the notion that the clinical picture of depression in the oldest old differs from that in younger elderly. Moreover, withstanding the serious negative effects of depression on well being and functioning, the detection rate of depression in several medical settings is low. Methods: Prevalence of depression, correlates and the rate of recognition by general practitioners were assessed in an 85-year-old community-based population. The GDS-S was applied in 500 participants with a MMSE >18, from a representative sample of 599 community based 85-year-old subjects. Demographic data, daily functioning, health correlates, use of medication and recognition of depression were recorded in home visits and from the general practitioner and pharmacists registers. Results: The prevalence of depression, as measured with a GDS-S score of 5 points or more, was 15.4%, which is comparable to previous studies. No demographic factors were correlated with depression. Perceived health, loneliness, impaired mobility, cognitive decline and functional disability were major correlates of depression. From the participants who were seen by their general practitioner, 25% were recognised as depressed. Antidepressive pharmacotherapy was almost nonexistent. Limitations: Formal diagnosis of depression was not available. The data were collected crossectionally. Conclusions: Depression is highly prevalent in the oldest old and strongly associated with functional disability and cognitive impairment. It is important to enhance recognition of depression in community based oldest old as a first step to possible interventions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It can be applied to postal districts and has been employed in studies examining the ecological associations of mental illness. Aims: We examine the utility of the Townsend index in identifying older populations with a high prevalence and risk of developing depression. Method: The study was carried out in the context of a cohort study of an age- and gender-stratified sample of 5222 community residents aged 65 years and over. Subjects were interviewed at intervals of two years. The relationships between Townsend score and psychiatric diagnoses (in particular, depression) were examined. Results: HighTownsend scores were associated with increased prevalence and incidence of depression and prevalence of organic psychiatric illness. Conclusions: The Townsend index can be used to prioritise psychiatric and primary care resources so as to cater for older populations likely to suffer from depression and organic psychiatric conditions.

26,Interdisciplinary collaboration as important success factor of technical innovations in Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistance,"In the last decade a small research community of social scientists and engineers has been established under the heading ""Adaptable Ambient Living"" (AAL), who attempts to find technical solutions for the demographical change. Technology transfer from basic research poses highest demands to the interdisciplinary cooperation in order to help elderly people. At the same time the product development is coming up to limits of affordability, limits of effectiveness and ethics. The rapid developments in the fields of social robotics and medicine as well as the urgency of the social problem turn AAL into one of the most innovative areas. The objective of this article is to explore the outcomes of interdisciplinary collaboration along the value added change including the fundamental research, product development and user inclusion site of view. The Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant (ALIAS) project aims to develop a mobile robot system that interacts with elderly users, monitors and provides cognitive assistance in daily life, and promotes social inclusion by creating connections to people and events in the wider world. The function of ALIAS is to keep the elderly users linked to the wide society and in this way to improve their quality of life by combating loneliness and increasing cognitively stimulating activities. ALIAS is embodied by a mobile robot platform with the capacity to monitor, interact with and access information from online services, without manipulation capabilities. ALIAS is not designed to replace human-human contacts, but rather, to enhance and promote these through the proposed wide range of integrated services. By serving as a monitor, a cognitive-prosthetic device and a facilitator of social contacts, the ALIAS system will significantly improve the daily life of elderly people. The ALIAS-project is characterized by a close cooperation of social scientist and engineers. The teams exchange information permanently and an interdisciplinary work of high quality is ensured. There is a permanent feedback between social and technical work packages. The objective is to develop a robot platform that adjusts to the individual wishes and needs of the elderly people. For this purpose the users have been involved at a very early stage of the project. Thus the research Area ""Gender Studies in Science"" has conducted inquiries, workshops and interviews with different user groups (e.g. seniors, relatives, caregivers and care consultants) and has realized a secondary analysis. The results of the investigations are fed back to the technical partners and have been incorporated into the development of the ALIAS platform. To provide technical solutions that are tailored to the requirements of the user groups a close cooperation in the overall project is necessary. That means the research teams also learn from the feedback of users. It is important, that the issues of the project are an inherent part in the work with elderly, of the interdisciplinary work between the teams in the project and also part of the engineering education, because the experiences and the results of ALIAS integrated in the engineering education. At the SEFI conference the very early involvement of different user groups in the development process and the results of the conducted inquiries as well as the technical implementation of the mobile robot platform should be highlighted and discussed with the conference attendees.",0,0,"no intervention, no SI, protocol",0,,,,,0.01998362425

The sample consisted of 20 elderly who participate in a course designed low assumptions of gerontology, which is the science that studies the changes in old age and during aging. The study was justified because most seniors are not prepared to deal with these technologies and as a result many of them are not active in the technological society, this creates feelings of loneliness, fear, ignorance and forgetfulness, among others. In addition, there is a profound shift in values and social attitudes, changes capable of causing a major rift between young people and their ancestors. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the inclusion of the elderly to today’s technological society, through the process of learning technologies in Baja California, México. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.3995168138
212,Objective Determinants of Perceived Social Support,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation and interpretation of supportive behaviors. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7668183705

The aims of this study were to report the prevalence of depression in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS), a community-based, cohort. Method. Following screening of 13 004 people aged 65 and over from a population base, a stratified random subsample of 2640 participants received the Geriatric Mental State (GMS) examination and were diagnosed using the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer-Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT) algorithm. Results. The prevalence of depression was 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3-10.2], increasing to 9.7% if subjects with concurrent dementia were included. Depression was more common in women (10.4%) than men (6.5%) and was associated with functional disability, co-morbid medical disorder, and social deprivation. Prevalence remained high into old age, but after adjustment for other associated factors, it was lower in the older age groups. Conclusions. The prevalence of depression in the elderly is high and remains high into old age, perhaps due to increased functional disability. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5666345882
242,Are high school students living in lodgings at an increased risk for internalizing problems?,"This study aimed to investigate whether leaving home to live in lodgings during senior high school can be a risk factor for the development of internalizing problems. Utilizing two large-scale prospective community studies of 2399 and 3906 Norwegian students (age range 15-19 years), respectively, the difference in internalizing symptoms between adolescents living in lodgings and adolescents living with their parents during senior high school was examined. Female students living in lodgings had higher scores on internalizing problems than female students living at home, whereas no differences were found for males. Living in lodgings did not predict later internalizing problems, and prior internalizing problems did not predict moving into lodgings. It is therefore suggested that the negative effect of living in lodgings on high school students' well-being is temporary. © 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6794500023
336,Rehabilitative therapy for the elderly chronic somatic disease complicated with depression,"Background: There is a complicated relation between somatic disease and mental disorder. Somatic disease may induce functional disorder of brain, and generate psychiatric symptoms due to the change of psychological and social environment. The proportion of depression in elder people based on the chronic somatic disease is much higher, and thus the fatality of them increases. Objective: To investigate the influence of single antidepressant, and therapeutic alliance of psychological and drug treatment on the rehabilitation of patients with elderly chronic somatic disease complicated with depression. Design: Randomized and controlled grouping experiment. Setting: Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Participants: Totally 10 2 patients were hospitalized in the Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology from March 2000 to January 2003, and all the patients had sleep disorder to a different extent, and suffered from symptoms of heart and alimentary tract which could not be explained as organic diseases, and chronic pain or systemic symptom. Their score of Zung scale was > 40 points with average of (48.83±4.15) points. The patients were randomly divided into the drug group (n=46) and the combined treatment group (n=56). Each patient had more than two somatic symptoms in the two groups and more than 81.0% of them had three somatic symptoms. Methods: According to the different primary diseases in patients of the two groups, regular treatment was given routinely. Oral thymoleptics fluoxetine of 20 mg/d 5-hydroxyltryptamine reuptake restrainer with 20 mg/d was administered, the dose of which could be added to 40 mg/d according to the pathogenetic conditions. At the beginning of the administration of oral antidepressant drugs, the patients in the combined treatment group were given the effective psychological direction immediately, which included: 1 The focal point of depression and fear was identified, and the comfort and psychological aid were given to reduce the anxiety. 2 The basic knowledge related to the disease was supplied, and the pathogenetic condition and the prognosis were told to the patients objectively. The family and society were encouraged to learn the rehabilitative skill and improve their self-care ability of daily life. 3 Demand of patient was satisfied as far as possible, and the family and society were encouraged to give the patients adequate psychological support and life support. The patient and the family were assisted to establish favorable communication. The feeling of loneliness and isolation was reduced, and the sense of safety was increased. The depression status and the quality of life of the patients in the two groups were evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after treatment with the Zung scale and the Spitzer quality of life index score (QLI), including 5 aspects: Activity, daily life, health, support and perspective. The highest score was 10 points. The lowest was 0, and the higher the score, the better the quality of life is. Main outcome measures: The results of the Zung scale and the QLI score evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after the treatment. Results: The treatment of the patients in the two groups was all finish ed and all of them entered the result analysis. 1 The total points of Zung scale in the drug group and the combined treatment group at 2 weeks after the treatment indicated that there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment (41.12±2.60, 48.83±4.15, t =10.67, P<0.05); (40.88±3.43, 49.03±4.21, t=11.24, P<0.05). There was not significant difference in group comparison. The total points of Zung scale at 8 weeks were significantly decreased (36.11±2.87), (30.71±3.62), and there was significant difference in comparison with that before the treatment. The combined treatment group was better than the drug group in group comparison at 8 weeks after treatment. 2 there was no significant difference of QLI score at 2 weeks between the drug group and combined treatment group before and after the treatment (5.47±1.33, 5.32±1.04, 5.55±1.18, 5.27±1.35). The QLI score of drug group and combined treat merit group at 8 weeks after treatment began to rise 7.21±0.13 and 8.83 ±0.32, respectively, and there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment, and there was also significant difference in group comparison. Conclusion: The positive and effective combined therapy of anti-depression significantly improved the somatic symptoms of patients, no complications appeared, and most patients presented optimistic attitude to the prognosis of the primary disease. To identify the depression of elder people in earlier period is very important to promote rehabilitation of the primary disease.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9081602055
119,Experience and expression of social isolation by inner-city high-rise residents,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the significance of social isolation and the factors that create social isolation for residents of inner-city high-rise apartment communities. We critically examine how the physical environment and perceptions of safety in apartment buildings and the inner-city implicate the quality of interactions between residents and with their neighbourhood community.Design/methodology/approach: The authors used mixed-methods consisting of survey questionnaires supplemented by semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions using stratified random sampling to access predetermined key strata of inner-city high-rise resident population. Using coefficient of correlation we examine the significance of the association between social isolation, age and ethnicity amongst Auckland's inner-city high-rise residents.Findings: The authors found the experience and expression of social isolation consistent across all age groups, with highest correlation between functional social isolation and ""being student"", and older adults (60 + years), length of tenure in current apartment and length of time residents have lived in the inner-city.Research limitations/implications: As a case study, we did not seek in this research to compare the experience and expressions of social isolation in different inner-city contexts, nor of inner-city high-rise residents in New Zealand and other countries, although these will be useful areas to explore in future studies.Practical implications: This study is a useful starting point to build evidence base for professionals working in health and social care services to develop interventions that will help reduce functional social isolation amongst young adults and older adults in inner-city high-rise apartments. This is particularly important as the inner-city population of older adults grow due to international migration, and sub-national shifts from suburbs to the inner-cities in response to governmental policies of urban consolidation.Originality/value: By identifying two forms of social isolation, namely functional and structural social isolation, we have extended previous analysis of social isolation and found that ""living alone"" or structural social isolation did not necessarily lead to functional social isolation. It also touched on the links between functional social isolation and self-efficacy of older adults, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3598950357
376,Can playing massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) improve older adults’ socio-psychological wellbeing?,"This study examined whether playing Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) improves older adults’ socio-psychological wellbeing. We analyzed the relationships of older adults’ social interactions in MMORPGs to three socio-psychological factors: loneliness, depression, and social support. Social interactions in MMORPGs were conceptualized into four components: communication methods, network level, enjoyment of relationships and quality of guild play. A total of 222 respondents aged 55 years or more who played World of Warcraft (WoW) were recruited through an online survey. It was found that the biggest effect sizes of loneliness, depression, and social support were associated with enjoyment of relationships and quality of guild play. In addition, amount of gameplay had a little impact on older adults’ socio-psychological wellbeing. Therefore, the socio-psychological impacts of playing MMORPGs on older adults are much dependent on the enjoyment of relationships and quality of guild play. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,?,"survey, no intervention",0,,,,,0.9795077752
282,Geriatric depression scale (GDS): A tool for assessment of depression in elderly,"Background: India is in the process of rapid demographic progression of increased life expectancy and aging with geriatric population of 7.2 percent which is estimated to rise to 20 percent in 2050. With increasing geriatric population elderly with dementia and associated depressive illness are expected to rise in number to almost an epidemic. Among the morbidity encountered in elderly, depressive disorders are common. Aim & Objectives: The present study was conducted with the objective to assess the extent and degree of depression in elderly, and study some correlates associated with depression in them. Material & Methods: The study was carried out at geriatric clinic of Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Pune under the guidance of department of community medicine. Methodology: The randomly selected elderly above the age of 60 years attending the clinic and willing to participate in study were administered the questionnaire of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), scores were given, based on which the subjects were categorized as mild, moderate and severe. Those with score >5 were considered as suggestive of depression and some factors studied were analysed to find out their association with depression. Results: It was revealed that the proportion of elderly having depression was 52.4% with 84.6% of depressed in age group of 76-80 years. Moderate to severe type was more commonly seen in illiterate; however some degree of depression was present in all elderly irrespective of literacy status. Moderate to severe type was seen more commonly in elderly living in nuclear families (23.8%), and living alone (33.3%). Thus more than half of elderly studied were having depression, and it was observed that as the age advanced the degree of depression significantly increased. Some of the factors studied like low education status, poor economic status, nuclear family status, single status, loneliness, were associated with depression. The GDS Scale can be considered as a tool for early detection and prompt action. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression in elderly is a matter of concern. The GDS can be used as a simple, easy to use, non-intervention based tool for early detection and prompt action. Tackling the health related issues like depression along with social and income security will go a long way in adding life to their years instead of years to life of elderly. © Journal of Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences University",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.469425725
313,The older cancer survivor: Living arrangements and social supports,"There are more than 9.5 million cancer survivors in the United States, and the majority of them are older people who will need a safe environment to live out their lives. Appropriately designed homes for older adults can greatly enhance their quality of life and allow them to ""age in place."" The older person's current home usually needs modifications to ensure safety and reduce barriers to performing tasks of daily living. This article explores recommended home modifications and discusses where people can obtain help in carrying out the necessary modifications. It also reviews housing options for the elderly, including naturally occurring retirement communities, home sharing, accessory dwelling units, congregate housing, assisted living facilities, and continuing care retirement communities. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

109,"Role of social factors on cell death, cerebral plasticity and recovery after stroke","Stroke is a serious global health care problem. It is now is the fourth leading cause of death and the primary cause of adult disability in the United States. Substantial evidence from both experimental and clinical studies has demonstrated that social isolation (SI) can increase stroke incidence and impair recovery. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that an increasing number of patients are living alone, and as the aging population increases, loneliness will only increase in prevalence. SI is increasingly identified as an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. In contrast, individuals with high levels of social support exhibit more rapid and extensive functional and cognitive recovery after a wide variety of pathological insults, including stroke. Clinical data suggests that SI is an important risk factor for increased mortality and delayed functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Attesting to the importance of mortality and behavioral factors in stroke outcome is that these same effects can be reproduced in animal models of experimental stroke. This has allowed researchers to identify several mechanistic changes that occur with affiliative interactions. These include decreased systemic inflammation, elaboration of growth factors including brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), enhanced neurogenesis, and improved neuroimmune responsiveness in group housed animals. These may mediate the beneficial effects of social interaction on improving stroke recovery and reducing neuronal death. In this review we provide an overview of the effects of SI on ischemic injury and recovery and discuss their clinical and therapeutic implications. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7621290599
199,Social engagement and its relationship to health,"Theoretical challenges: Early findings on various forms of social engagement and their benefits for individual health have been promising. The largest and strongest body of evidence is currently available for social contacts and relationships, whereas fewer studies address the health-related consequences of educational, intellectual, and productive activities. If the suggestive findings can be replicated and explicated, they will have important implications for how older adults live their lives: remaining active is not only good for society and satisfies the American work ethic, but it is also good for older adults themselves. A recommendation to remain active and socially engaged can be implemented by older adults themselves and is relatively easy to follow, often without high-tech requirements or costly outlays. Such a recommendation, however, may be somewhat premature because at this point we lack a good understanding of many specific features of the relationship. First, in the available research, many different activities have been investigated, and they usually have been studied in a rather aggregate fashion and have been aggregated in many different and often conceptually uninformed ways. Research needs to investigate specific activities in a disaggregated form (ie, to test whether the effect of a specific activity is not simply a reflection of another related activity, a range of other activities must be controlled in such studies). For example, the few studies that investigated the effect of social activities while explicitly controlling on physical activities were able to show an independent effect of social activities on health [38,48]. A related challenge lies in the identification of the mechanisms underlying the link between activities and health. Recent research has seen the investigation of fairly specific activities, examining for example intellectual or productive activities. Yet, this research has operationalized the nature of activities in a rather limited fashion by grouping activities posthoc into content categories. Future research must develop independent measurement of the underlying mechanism - social, productive, cognitive, competence-building, identity-related, and physical - of the activities it investigates. Examples of such independent ratings can be found in exploratory research on the meaning of volunteer and educational activities [25,78] and in the occupational rating scales used in some studies on work and stress [79]. According to self, adaptation, and continuity theories, it also would seem critical whether older individuals are seeking or performing certain activities to promote future goals and adjustments to age-related changes and to maintain a current state (ie, whether a certain activity corresponds to their personal preference). It might be hypothesized that activities performed in pursuit of a desirable goal or valued state are more beneficial than those without such purpose. As noted above, in our past research [54], we reported a finding that appears consistent with such a hypothesis: in a cross-sectional examination of health and paid work we found evidence that work and retirement were related to health and well-being if they were voluntarily chosen activities, but not if they were being carried out involuntarily. But clearly, the role of the correspondence of activities with personal preferences and goals requires further research. Future research also needs to pursue the intriguing suggestion emerging from some of the early studies that the relationship between an activity and its health consequence occurs with relatively small amounts of time spent on the activity and is not necessarily a linear function of the amount of time. Theories, such as self theory or busy ethic, provide an explanation for this finding: to pursue a certain goal or document being busy, a relatively small amount of the activity may suffice. In adopting such a conclusion, however, we must be able to exclude the alternative explanation of error in activities measurement. We will return to measurement error below. At this point, we do not have a good understanding of the range of health consequences of activities. To address the generality versus specificity of the effects, we need a systematic exploration of the various health outcomes including the dimensions of physical and mental health and the stages in the disablement process of diseases, impairment, disability, and death, including the transitions between them. Future research must incorporate the complex interrelationships between health and activities and the mix of positive and negative effects. Much research documents the fact that healthier older adults are more likely to become and stay active, and this effect needs to be represented when studying the effects of activities on health. Most likely, health and activities are interlinked in a complex pattern of reciprocal causation: Health problems tend to cause a reduction in activities; reduced activities cause further health deterioration; and so on. Also, in most instances, activities probably exert positive and negative effects on subsequent health and the final effect reflects the relative balance between the positive and negative effects. A prime example is caregiving. Although most of the relevant research investigates negative consequences caused by burden, anecdotal and a small body of empirical evidence document positive effects in terms of the satisfaction, self-esteem, and increased feelings of closeness to the care recipient that derive from care provision [80-83]. Methodologic Challenges: Measurement: The measurement of activities has proved difficult, and error in these measures may well contribute to the inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between activities and their health consequences. Standard survey questions, as used in most of the relevant research to measure the presence and quantity of activities, suffer from several likely response errors. These errors include difficulties in understanding labels of relatively aggregated activity categories, such as ""visiting with friends and relatives,"" the difficulty of reporting exact time spent on each category of activities, and the likelihood of context and wording biases [84-86]. Alternative measurement strategies, such as time diaries or experiential sampling methods, in which respondents describe their activities in their own words for subsequent coding and in which time is measured close to the performance of the activity, are thought to provide more valid measurement of the quantity of specific activities than the standard survey questions [84]. These measures are lengthy and costly, however, and thus of limited usefulness for large sample-based surveys. The measurement of the quality of activities is also circumspect because typically the quality has been assigned on a posthoc basis rather than based on independent assessment. Direction of causation: Determining the direction of causation between activity and health outcomes is very difficult without good information about the temporal ordering of activity and disease trajectory because of the possibility of a selection effect. The selection effect refers to the possibility that healthy older adults are more likely to participate in most activities than are older adults with health problems. Only longitudinal studies allow researchers to properly establish the causal ordering by investigating activity patterns that precede health status in time and by controlling on pre-existing health problems. Even in longitudinal observational studies a researcher can never be entirely certain that all preexisting physical and mental health problems and other possible confounders have been adequately controlled, and thus some confounding by selection may persist. Ultimately, experimental or intervention studies must be used to test the effect of activity on health. In one of the few relevant examples [87], a randomly chosen group of older adult applicants was enrolled into half-time work on a gardening program, whereas another random group of applicants served as controls. After 18 weeks, the enrolled group reported higher life satisfaction and better self-perceived health than adults who were not enrolled in the program. It must be recognized, however, that intervention studies have their own limitations, such as the difficulty of randomly assigning life styles and the difficulty of obtaining representative samples. Interdisciplinary research: Results from the social science and epidemiologic literatures are quite suggestive of the manifold benefits of remaining socially engaged in later life. This topic has only recently gained the attention of the medical communities. Research collaborations among biomedical, behavioral, and social scientists may be essential for advancing this important topic. To facilitate such interdisciplinary work, attention to theoretical, conceptual, and measurement issues would appear to be paramount.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.4159545316
154,"A causal model of depression among older adults in Chon Buri Province, Thailand","The purposes of this study are to develop and empirically test a theoretical model that examines the relationships between a set of predictors and depression among older adults. A biopsychosocial model was tested with 317 community dwelling older adults residing in Chon Buri Province, Thailand. A face-to-face interview was used in a cross-sectional community-based survey. A hypothesized model of depression was tested by using path analysis. It was found that the modified model fitted the data and the predictors accounted for 60% of the variance in depression. Female gender, activities of daily living, loneliness, stressful life events, and emotional-focused coping had a positive direct effect on depression. Social support and problem-focused coping had a negative direct effect on depression. Additionally, perceived stress, stressful life events, loneliness, and income had a negative indirect effect on depression through social support. Female gender, activities of daily living, and perceived stress also had a positive indirect effect on depression through emotional-focused coping. Stressful life events, perceived stress, and income had a negative indirect effect on depression through problem-focused coping. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the variables that predict depression in older adults. Thus, health care providers should consider the effects of these contributing factors on depression in the older adult person and can devise a program to prevent and promote health in older adults alleviating depression. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3519273892

93,Depression and Psychosocial Risk Factors among Community-Dwelling Older Adults in Singapore,"Depression is the most common mental and emotional disorder that emerges in the late stages of life. It is closely associated with poor health, disability, mortality, and suicide. The study examines the risk factors of depression in late life, especially the psychosocial factors, among a sample comprising 162 community-dwelling Singaporean adults aged 65 years and above. An interview-based structured survey was conducted in multiple senior activity centers located in different parts of Singapore. Results from the hierarchical regression analysis show that 32.9 % of the variance in geriatric depression can be explained by the three psychosocial factors, among which loneliness, perceived social support, and the emotional regulation component of resilience are significantly associated with depression in older adults. Large-scale studies should be conducted to confirm the findings of the present study, and to further examine the predictive effects of these psychosocial factors on depression among older adults. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7158380697
148,Impact of a horticultural therapy program on the well-being of low-income community dwelling older adults,"Due to the exponentially aging population, it is becoming increasingly necessary to find effective, affordable, and easily implemented interventions for successful aging. Informal use of horticultural therapy (HT) as an intervention is increasing with older adults, adding to anecdotal evidence of its positive impact. However, empirical research showing its effectiveness continues to be lacking. This pilot study was conducted with two main goals. The first, was to repeat HT activities used in previous studies to form a structured HT program and the second, to determine the impact of a HT program on well-being, self-esteem, self efficacy, and social isolation on a group of community dwelling older adults. A six-week HT program was developed using activities from an unpublished handbook, ""Horticultural Therapy and Seniors Using Herbs: A Manual for Recreational Therapists and Master Gardeners"" (Relf, unpublished). HT activities were conducted weekly with three separate groups of community dwelling older adults. Measures of well-being (WHO-5 Well-Being Index), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale), self efficacy (Garden Experience Measure), and social isolation (The Friendship Scale) were taken before and after the program. Treatment groups were compared to a waitlist control group on all four measures. The resulting analysis showed a statistically significant difference in self-esteem and some aspects of self efficacy of the treatment group over the waitlist control group. In addition, participants' feedback on their experience of the program proved to be overwhelmingly positive. This HT program meets the criteria of an effective, affordable, and easily implemented intervention and will hopefully encourage more use of HT with older adults.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3025821033
8,The use of telephone befriending in low level support for socially isolated older people - an evaluation,"There is increasing policy recognition that the alleviation of social isolation and loneliness in older people should be prioritised. Recently, technology, such as telephone networks and the Internet, has received attention in supporting isolated and lonely older people. Despite lack of evidence, telephone befriending has been considered an effective low-level method to decrease loneliness among older people. This study evaluated the impact of a national befriending scheme for isolated and/or lonely older people, involving eight project sites across the UK 2007-2008. The purpose was to assess the impact of different models of telephone-based befriending services on older people's health and well-being. A mixed methods approach was used. This paper reports on the findings from 40 in-depth interviews with older service recipients. The most important finding was that the service helped older people to gain confidence, re-engage with the community and become socially active again. Three topics were identified: why older people valued the service, what impact it had made on their health and well-being and what they wanted from the service. In addition, nine subthemes emerged: life is worth living, gaining a sense of belonging, knowing they had a friend, a healthy mind is a healthy body, the alleviation of loneliness and anxiety, increased self-confidence, ordinary conversation, a trusted and reliable service, the future - giving something back. In conclusion, the findings present in-depth qualitative evidence of the impact of telephone befriending on older people's well-being. Befriending schemes provide low-cost means for socially isolated older people to become more confident and independent and develop a sense of self-respect potentially leading to increased participation and meaningful relationships. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",1,1,INCLUDED,1,1,1,1,1,0.2130475343
314,Impairment and abuse of elderly by staff in long-term care in Michigan: Evidence from structural equation modeling,"Elder abuse in long-term care has become a very important public health concern. Recent estimates of elder abuse prevalence are in the range of 2% to 10% (Lachs & Pillemer, 2004), and current changes in population structure indicate a potential for an upward trend in prevalence (Malley-Morrison, Nolido, & Chawla, 2006; Post et al., 2006). More than 20 years ago, Karl Pillemer called for sociological research on patient maltreatment in nursing homes and provided an overview model for the conduct of such research (Pillemer, 1988). The research literature since then has not provided the definitive model to account for patient maltreatment that Pillemer hoped for. Instead, it has produced a laundry list of risk factors that includes the patient's functional disability, cognitive impairment, social isolation, age, race, income, family background, life events, dementia, and depression (Dyer, Pavlik, Murphy, & Hyman, 2000; Lachs & Pillemer, 2004; Lachs,Williams, Obrien, Hurst, & Horwitz, 1997; Pavlik, Hyman, Festa, & Dyer, 2001; Schofield & Mishra, 2003). However, no theory exists to place these factors in a causal structure that relates the factors to each other and to whether abuse occurs. This study is a first step in that direction. Nine hypotheses were generated focusing on the effects of two dimensions of impairment-(a) physical and cognitive and (b) age and behavior problems-on susceptibility to abuse among elderly in long-term care.The relationships between factors and from factors to susceptibility to abuse are specified in a structural equation model where ""susceptibility to abuse,"" ""physical impairment,"" and ""cognitive impairment"" are latent variables, and behavior problems and age are directly measured. © The Author(s) 2011.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4965913
47,Prototyping TV and tablet facebook interfaces for older adults,"With the daily problem of social isolation comes an aggravation of older adults’ general health. Social Network Services like Facebook have the potential to ameliorate the social connectivity of this segment of the population. However, they are still not fully adopted by them, whether because of age-related limitations or the lack of appropriate technological skills. In this paper we argue that the development of SNSs based on technology already used by older adults, like Television, or technology which has proven to be more accessible to them, like Tablets, can improve the ability of older adults to use these systems. We report findings from a study composed of semi-structured interviews and focus groups which aimed at the development of two Facebook-based prototypes for TV and Tablet. Results show good receptiveness from older adults to perform social tasks on TV and Tablet-based applications, for interacting using alternative modalities like speech, or back-of-device tapping, and for the use of adaptation mechanisms. Informed by the study results the main contributions are the two prototypes, and a collection of recommendations regarding the design of TV and tablet based interfaces for this population. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.3383443419
121,Psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the Spanish version of the 11-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale,"Background: Loneliness has been associated with physical and mental health problems. It has also been considered a serious social problem that increases the use and costs of health services. The most widely used instrument in Europe for measuring loneliness is the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS). The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the 11-item DJGLS by means of the Rasch model, and its convergent and discriminant validity. Methods: Participants were a representative sample of Spanish community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older. We evaluated sociodemographic variables, health, social support, social activity, and subjective well-being measures. Results: Person and item fit statistics, and standardized residual principal component analysis revealed that the DJGLS was essentially unidimensional.However, we found DIF acrossmarital status and living arrangements. Moderate to high associations were found between loneliness and depression, self-rated loneliness, positive and negative emotions, and satisfaction with life. The DJGLS differentiated between well known-groups according to gender, marital status, living arrangements, health, structural and functional aspects of social networks, and social activity. Conclusions: The DJGLS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring loneliness in Spanish older adults. The addition of a few items in order to improve the measurement range is strongly recommended. Our findings are consistent with previous research indicating that loneliness is an important aspect of mental health and subjective well-being, and support the use of the scale to detect vulnerable population in old age. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2014.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3341702178
48,Social connector: A ubiquitous system to ease the social interaction among family community members,"A family community is usually composed of three generations: elders, adults and young people. During the last years, adults and young people tend to use social media to support the interaction among them. However, this tendency is isolating the elderly, because they are usually reluctant to use computing technology. Social isolation negatively impacts the physical and mental health of the elderly. Although there are some social solutions that are suitable for elders, they are usually not comfortable for the other members in their families, producing an interaction deadlock that also generates social isolation in the elderly. Trying to help dealing with this problem, this paper proposes the use of a ubiquitous system, named SocialConnector, which is capable of boosting the social interaction between elders and their close relatives. The preliminary results indicate that SocialConnector is well accepted by the family members, particularly by the elderly, and it also allows increasing the social interaction from/to the elderly. © 2015 CRL Publishing Ltd.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.1086957518
337,Relation of oxytocin to psychological stress responses and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity in older women,"Objective: Animal research suggests that oxytocin (OT) plays a role in stress responses and that in females, this role is modulated by estrogen. Yet little is known about the relation of OT to human stress responses. This study was conducted to examine the relations between estrogen activity and OT, identify stressors distinctively associated with elevations in OT, and investigate whether OT is related to cardiovascular and hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortical (HPA) activity in a laboratory challenge paradigm. Methods: Seventy-three postmenopausal women who were on hormone therapy (HT) or not completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress and social relationships and then participated in a laboratory stress challenge (Trier Social Stress Task), during which OT, cortisol, and blood pressure were assessed. Results: HT was significantly associated with higher plasma OT. Controlling for HT, elevated plasma OT was significantly associated with gaps in social relationships, with less positive relationships with a primary partner, and with elevated cortisol levels. OT was not associated with stress reactivity or recovery. Conclusion: In women, plasma OT signals relationship stress and is associated with elevated cortisol; it does not appear to significantly affect cortisol or blood pressure responses to acute stress.

348,Nutritional risk assessment and obesity in rural older adults: A sex difference,"Background: Many older Americans are overweight or obese, but it is unclear whether obesity is associated with other nutritional risk indicators. Objective: This study investigated sex-associated differences in nutritional risk among community-dwelling, rural older adults and determined whether weight status [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) and waist circumference] was related to other measures of nutritional risk. Design: This cross-sectional study explored relations between weight status and nutritional risk, which was determined on the basis of the Level II Screen, overall diet quality, nutrient intakes, and plasma biomarkers. Results: Of the 179 subjects, 44% were overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and 35% were obese (BMI &gt; 30). There were few differences in nutrient intakes between older men and women after we controlled for energy intake. In women, BMI was directly associated with multiple additional nutritional risk indicators, including the number of Level II items (r = 0.30), intakes of fat (r = 0.26) and saturated fat (r = 0.21), and homocysteine concentration (r = 0.25). Weight status in women was inversely associated with intakes of carbohydrates (r = -0.25), fiber (r = -0.35), folate (r = -0.24), magnesium (r = -0.29), iron (r = -0.22), and zinc (r = -0.23); Healthy Eating Index scores (r = -0.22); and plasma pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (r = -0.30). Associations with waist circumference were similar. In men, weight status was associated only with plasma cobalamin (r = -0.33 for BMI) and pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (r = -0.24 for waist circumference). Conclusions: Overweight and obese older women, particularly those living alone, may be at greater nutritional risk than are men with a high BMI. Targeted nutritional intervention emphasizing nutrient-dense food choices to improve dietary patterns may be warranted.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4979921195
70,User interface of multimedia delivery platform for the elderly,"The world is facing the phenomena of rapidly growing population of the aged, in which there are more elderly people than children. The elderly people tend to live longer and hence have to live alone and feel lonely in large part due to healthcare advancement globally and structural social changes. This causes a great deal of concerns for loneliness, social isolation, and depression among the elderly. The elderly people also have mobility and vision-reducing eye problems. Therefore, it is important for the family to provide the proper health and social care environment to assist the elderly's daily living in order to enable them to live quality lives. This study aims to design and develop an interactive (bidirectional) multimedia delivery system to deliver multimedia contents among elderly people, family members, relatives and friends, and healthcare providers. The elderly can chat and send multimedia contents from a tablet PC via smart TV to family members and friends. Multimedia contents and the chat history are displayed on the elderly's smart TVs. The elderly can control the smart TV multimedia delivery application with ease by using our developed tablet PC touchpad features.

40,Design and Technologies for Understanding Older Adults Social Interactions in Retirement Communities,"Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces are a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote utilization of- and socialization in- shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design, development, and technology studies conducted for understanding the social interactions of older adults in retirement communities. To understand current use of shared spaces, observational studies were conducted in a retirement community. Moreover, interventions were implemented to evaluate the impact of designed technologies in shared spaces. The results motivate the need for an automated behavioral mapping surveillance system to quantify social interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. This paper describes the development of a video-based analysis system for understanding social interactions among older adults in retirement communities. Specific emphasis is given to describing the automated behavioral mapping surveillance system designed to monitor the number, length, and type of interactions of older adults in retirement communities. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using video cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment, and discuss the development of a surveillance system specifically for quantifying social interaction.

189,The experience of loneliness of battered old women,"The present article is part of a larger study examining the life stories of battered old women (Buchbinder & Winterstein, 2003; Winterstein, 2002). It is based on long in-depth interviews with twenty-one aging women who lived with violence for a significant portion of their lives. While the larger study examines a broad range of their experience, including loneliness, regret, expectations of the future, and an attempt to build a monument to their suffering, the present study focuses on loneliness, which appears to constitute the central theme of their existential experience. Content analysis of the interviews shows that loneliness is experienced on all ecological levels, including the self, the family of origin, the violent partner, the children, and the extended family. It also permeates the social relationships of the women and becomes the predominant motif of their social interactions. The combination of loneliness, violence, and old age creates suffering that colors everyday life and becomes not only the constant background against which life unfolds but also the governing variable in their experience. Their cognitive maps, emotional world, and overall sense of self, as well as their sense of existential continuity in the world are all affected by loneliness. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

36,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",0,0,"no OA, no intervention, no SI",0,,,,,0.1877144925
369,What about our responsibility toward the abandoned elderly?,"There are many who believe that each of us is by destiny cast into specific roles to make our individual contributions to our families, our fellows, and our society. Be it destiny or circumstance, it is fortuitous that Donald P. Kent chose sociology as his field of interest, that he further chose aging as his subject area, and that, in practice, he became a teacher and administrator of social policy. My theme for this address has been chosen with Donald Kent's humane philosophies in mind. I shall suggest that there is an urgent need to take future-facing measures in national planning and policy making instead of depending upon backward-facing measures. In order to do this, I think we must be prepared to reformulate policies and approaches which prove, in practice, to be faulty or fail to achieve their goal. This will involve asking questions as: Why did a policy fail? Could the failure have been foreseen and prevented? How might the gerontological community and this society have intervened at a propitious moment when the policies and procedures were first being generated to assure that they were sound and could be successfully implemented? The deinstitutionalization of elderly mental patients is the specific policy I will use to develop my thesis. I have chosen this policy not only because of its importance or because it is an isolated instance of a catastrophe in policy implementation, but rather because the goal of the policy was humane and because I believe that if forward-facing measures had been taken, the program could have succeeded and much of the misery of the unintended abandonment of many old people could have been avoided.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8228790211
14,"The Silver Line Helpline: A ""childLine"" for older people","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the work of the new, free telephone helpline The Silver Line in empowering older people to overcome social isolation and loneliness, and where appropriate refer cases of abuse and neglect to specialist services.Design/methodology/approach - Beginning with a family member's description of how the helpline made a difference to her relative this paper then outlines the rationale, methods and outcomes of The Silver Line, including a role it may play in reducing demand for NHS services.Findings - The paper highlights that social isolation and loneliness can be tackled through a helpline which leaves control firmly in the hands of callers while offering them a gateway to activities and services.Practical implications - It seems that telephone contact is a particularly helpful way for isolated people to begin to build social contact given that there is evidence of a stigma associated with admitting to loneliness.Social implications - Given a straightforward way to connect to others, people are empowered to overcome their own loneliness, improve their well-being and sometimes to rejoin their community. The charity reports that callers to the helpline may themselves become volunteer befrienders (""Silver Line Friends"") providing support to others and gaining evidence of their own value to society. In addition, a friendly chat over the phone can be an enabling link to gaining new skills, such as computer literacy, which may otherwise seem out of reach or irrelevant.Originality/value - The paper emphasises the importance of this helpline specifically and the wider need for hard to reach, isolated older people to have an accessible stepping stone to greater social contact and a higher quality of life. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,1,no intervention,0,,,,,0.8599686589
263,Practical issues related to the implication of elderlies in the design process-The case of a Living Lab approach for designing and evaluating social TV services,"Ageing well at home cannot be reduced to the management of physical and cognitive frailties and technologies should also tackle the quality of life of the elderly by fostering their social interactions especially for those who are living alone. The Internet could play a role in alleviating elderly loneliness, in order to cope with their social frailty. But designing appropriate services and ensuring their adoption by the elderlies remain open questions. We try to provide answers at the methodological and practical levels by reflecting on an approach based on the participation of the future users as part of a ""Living Lab"". For so doing, we report feedback from our work in a European project aiming at developing and evaluating social TV services. Our return on experience contributes to recommendations for an effective implication of elderly people in the design and evaluation process. © 2015 AGBM.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.03783690511
301,Factors associated with perceived health in older adult Irish population,"Objectives: Perceived health status or self-reported health declines with age and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, poor mental health and functional outcomes and health care utilisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a range of biopsychosocial measures and self-reported health in a sample of community-dwelling older people living in Dublin. Method: A total of 492 participants with a mean age of 72.5 (SD=7.34) were assessed at the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in St James's Hospital, Dublin, using standardised measures of medical morbidity, personality, functional status, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, cognition, loneliness and social support. The relationship between self-rated health and health measures was analysed using bivariate correlations and backward multiple regression. Indirect pathways of effects on perceived health were evaluated using bootstrapping mediation analysis. Results: Self-rated health was best predicted by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI), extraversion and perceived stress. The effects of cognition and social support from friends on self-rated health were found to be mediated by elements of these identified factors. Conclusion: Self-rated health is not simply the absence of physical illness but is also strongly influenced by the degree of functional impairment, personality factors and the level of stress experienced by the older person. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4004253033
96,To a Deeper Understanding of Loneliness amongst Older Irish Adults,"Loneliness can play a significant role in the wellbeing of older adults. This article describes a qualitative method for using case notes from the clinical records of older individuals in order to investigate the priority concerns spontaneously reported by older adults to deepen our understanding of both the context in which reported loneliness occurs in Ireland and the potential triggers. The participants in this study represent a cross-section of older adults who participated in the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic (TRIL). Data were collected from participants through interviewer case notes at the TRIL centre in St James's hospital, Dublin. 624 participants (431 females; 193 males) ranging in age from 60-92 years (Mean 73 years, SD 7 years) took part in the study. All were community dwelling and provided consent. A thematic analysis from grounded theory was used to evaluate the case notes for each participant. Preliminary results highlight the richness of phenomenological experience to enhance our understanding of loneliness and provide an opportunity to better understand the precursors and variability that loneliness may take. In this study we found themes in the case note analysis linking social loneliness with self-imposed limitations on social engagement due to declining health while predominate themes for emotionally lonely focused on psychological issues of stress and anxiety associated with adverse life events. The results suggest the importance of case notes to inform clinical practice. Qualitative results provided insights into differing live events of older Irish adults, which help distinguish the causal differences between social and emotional loneliness.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.07712502745
365,The elderly subject and social violence: the body as a factor in communication [Le sujet âgé et la violence sociale: le corps comme facteur de communication.],"The social inferiority of an elderly person stems from his physical inferiority--actual or alleged but always possible. And yet this ""inferior"" body is paradoxically hypertrophic: at first it masks the person, then takes up its space until it negates it. Hence, an elderly person is not only a body but a lonely body. In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it. This is why their body's language is violent: their body cries out, it is stunned and it is acted upon (even--and unavoidably--in relations with a therapist).",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.1115215861
178,Examining social isolation by gender and geography: Conceptual and operational challenges using population health data in Canada,"In 2003, the Canadian Federal/Provincial/Territorial Task Force on Seniors identified social isolation as an important issue for further study and policy development given that socially isolated persons are considered to be more vulnerable to both inappropriate use of the health care system and poorer health outcomes. In order to provide adequate support to this vulnerable population, it is critical to untangle the complex web of relationships that influence the need for care, and the health status and service utilization patterns of socially isolated older adults. Using data from the 2000-01 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), this article explores social isolation as a multidimensional social construct examining in particular the axes of gender and geography to try to tease out some of this complexity and its relationship to health status and service utilization. When individual characteristics like gender are considered together with broader contextual variables like place of residence, a more comprehensive and layered portrait of vulnerability among socially isolated persons begins to emerge with insights into their unique patterns of health and service use. For example, home care may be an extremely critical resource for keeping older women in their homes and out of hospital. On the other hand, among socially isolated older men, those living in rural communities may be particularly 'invisible', neither benefiting from home care nor having strong social supports. It seems plausible then that both men and women may be in need of special interventions or targeted programmes to help them to remain, or to become, more socially integrated in their communities as they age in place. In addition, this article addresses some of the limitations of using both a quantitative analytic approach and the CCHS dataset itself in grappling with such complexity.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7326310749
353,"Risk factors for late-life suicide: A prospective, community-based study","Despite the fact that people age 65 and older have the highest rates of suicide of any age-group, late-life suicide has a low prevalence, making it difficult to conduct prospective studies. The authors examined risk factors for late-life suicide on the basis of general information collected directly from older subjects participating in a community-based prospective study of aging, the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Demographic variables, presence of a relative or friend to confide in, alcohol use, and sleep quality were assessed at baseline interview. Baseline and follow-up data were used to determine physical, cognitive, and affective functioning, as well as medical status. Of 14,456 people, 21 committed suicide over the 10-year observation period. Depressive symptoms, perceived health status, sleep quality, and absence of a relative or friend to confide in predicted late-life suicide. Suicide victims did not have greater alcohol use and did not report more medical illness or physical impairment. This study provided additional information about the context of late-life depression that also contributes to suicidal behavior: poor perceived health, poor sleep quality, and limited presence of a relative or friend to confide in.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2694844205
15,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors. © The Authors, 2014.",0,1,no intervention,0,,,,,0.7384839712
334,Dignity in health and social care for older Europeans: Implications of a European project,"Dignity is often cited in policies and papers relating to older people, yet there is little evidence regarding what dignity means in practice or how it may be best promoted in health and social care. The Dignity and Older Europeans Project explored these issues with older people and care professionals in a crossnational study. Dignity was seen as a highly relevant and important concept, enhancing self-esteem, self-worth and wellbeing. In general the participants found it easier to identify situations when dignity was lacking than to identify times when it was present or what it meant. For the dignity of older people to be enhanced, person-centered care must address communication issues, privacy, personal identity and feelings of vulnerability. In particular, there is a need for education of all health and social professionals to better appreciate what dignity means and for policies that promote greater dignity for all older people in society. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8585111402
42,Older adults and the use of internet communication: Results from a German study-sample,"Background: Although much is known about communication patterns of young people, communication habits of older people still seem to be to be a neglected area of research. This seems surprising considering the great importance of information exchange, especially for this age group. Communication enables older people to participate in social life and thus can prevent loneliness and isolation. Methods: After conducting a systematic literature search a questionnaire was designed to assess possible factors influencing the use of the internet for communication reasons. 150 persons aged 60 years and older were asked about socio-demographic information, conversation durations and dialogue partners. Additionally, participants were asked about subjective advantages and disadvantages of internet communication. Results: Almost 50 % of the participants reported using the internet for communication (mainly e-mail). In particular, the socio-demographic factors age, gender and education influenced the use of internet for communication. Besides socio-demographic factors, we demonstrated that daily telephone use influences the use of the internet for communication. Contrary to our expectations, family situation, mobility and size of living area had no impact in this study-sample. Conclusion: Using the internet for communication can be a possible solution to some of the problems many older people have to face, such as loneliness and isolation. Currently, the internet is used by only a small part of older adults. In order to strengthen internet communication in older people, it is necessary to know about factors influencing the use of internet for communication. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.

6,Impact of computer training courses on reduction of loneliness of older people in Finland and Slovenia,"Previous research has shown loneliness as a threat for the quality of life of older people; therefore the goal of the intervention in a quasi-experimental study was to evaluate and discuss the self-reported level of loneliness of older people in Finland and Slovenia before and after a computer intervention. Intervention in a quasi-experimental study was conducted among 58 older participants at the baseline (M = 72.4 years) and 45 older participants at the follow-up research study (M = 72.9 years). Inferential statistics showed a significant difference in the reduction of loneliness between the countries, and a decreased level of loneliness of older people after completing the computer training course. Although older people experience many age-related problems which may reduce their interest in learning information and communication technology (ICT) skills, it is important that they are computer-proficient, because computer engagement can reduce the level of loneliness of older people and in this way has a positive effect on their quality of life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

5,The impact of ICT use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults,"Purpose: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities.41 Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties.12,19,41 However, prior research is not consistent in whether ICTs increase or decrease isolation and loneliness among older adults.12,19,26,41 The purpose of this study is to examine how ICT use impacts the social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. Method: Data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama is used. Simple regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between frequency of Internet use and isolation and loneliness. As the data comes from an intervention study (ICT training vs. No training), the analyses controlled for the arm of the study participants were in. Results &amp; Discussion: Results from post intervention surveys show that going online more frequently was associated with lower levels of loneliness and isolation. Greater frequency of Internet use was associated with greater quantity and ease of contact with others.

176,Community connections: An intergenerational and multicultural community group program,"Community Connections (CC) was launched in spring 2007 as a pilot program that includes international university students, older adults and caretakers, Center for Life Experiences (a faith-based community outreach program) staff, and community volunteers. CC is held every other Friday beginning in the late afternoon and extending into the early evening. The program is structured to offer mutual opportunities for activities built around exchanging multicultural and life experiences through the fine arts and small narrative storytelling groups. It provides a “community,” family-style meal that includes nutritionally healthy foods of both local and international cuisines. The goals of this community-based intergenerational group program are (a) to reduce the social isolation of older adults, caregivers, and international and multicultural students and to offer them the opportunity to get out of a limited social environment due to age, culture or confinement, caring for a family member, or declining health (b) to expand the opportunities for international and multicultural students to practice their English and learn more about local cultural and American traditions through interaction with community members in a social nonacademic setting; and (c) to build relationships between older adults needing to feel valued through sharing their life experiences and international students seeking the security of “extended family” relationships as are still common in many of their cultures. © Taylor&Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.05428839466
95,The impacts of community social capital on the life satisfaction of older adults in Hong Kong: the moderator role of intergenerational family capital,"Objective: This study examined the moderator role of intergenerational family capital on the relationship between community social capital and life satisfaction of older Chinese adults. Method: The data were derived from a quota sampling of 372 older adults aged 60 and above, who were interviewed at four districts in Hong Kong in 2011. Multiple group analysis was employed to examine the proposed model. Results: For the low family capital group, community social capital was found to be a significant predictor of life satisfaction, even when the well-known covariates were controlled. However, the association between community social capital and life satisfaction was statistically non-significant among the high family capital group. Discussion: The findings highlighted the interplay between community social capital and intergenerational family capital, which supported community social capital replacement theory in understanding the mechanism linking social capital to life satisfaction in older age in a Chinese context. Community social capital can play a compensatory role in maintaining the mental health of older people. It is particularly important for older adults who lack family support and/or suffer from social isolation and loneliness in local communities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7498026844
328,Philadelphia geriatric morale scale in essential tremor: A population-based study in three Spanish communities,"Essential tremor (ET) is associated with both functional disability and depression. Each could contribute to a poor sense of well-being and low morale. We hypothesized that morale would be lower in ET cases than controls. Using a population-based, cross-sectional design, morale was assessed in 187 ET cases and 561 matched controls living in three communities in central Spain using the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) (range = 0 [low morale]-17), which included three-dimensions of psychological well-being: agitation, lonely dissatisfaction, and attitude toward own aging. The PGCMS score was lower in ET cases than controls (9.41 ± 3.21 vs. 10.39 ± 2.92, P < 0.001), as were the Agitation subscore (3.17 ± 1.71 vs. 3.78 ± 1.67, P < 0.001) and Lonely Dissatisfaction subscore (3.75 ± 1.34 vs. 4.02 ± 1.24, P < 0.05). Nearly one-half of the ET cases were classified as having low morale compared with only one-third of controls (P = 0.006). In a linear regression analysis adjusting for demographic factors and multiple comorbid conditions, ET cases had a lower log PGCMS score than controls (P < 0.001). Exclusion of participants on antidepressant medication did not change the results. Our results indicate that morale is significantly lower in community-dwelling ET cases than in matched controls. This lower morale could in part be a proxy for mild, untreated depression. It therefore seems important to detect and then possibly treat this problem to improve the psychological well-being of patients with this disease. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9617603256

Even though much healthcare research is focused on autism, asthma, diabetes, to mention a few, depression caused by isolation is a serious condition related to healthy aging and outcomes. Addressing communication patterns across housing options might bring us closer to understanding and preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people.

272,Cochlear implant rehabilitation in older adults: Literature review and proposal of a conceptual framework,"Objectives To review studies investigating cochlear implant (CI) outcomes in older adults, and to develop a conceptual framework demonstrating important interactions between characteristics of hearing disability, aging, and the CI intervention. Design Review of English literature with titles containing the words ""cochlear implant"" and generic term referring to older adults or numerical value for age greater than 65. Results Hearing loss is a prevalent consequence of aging and poses special challenges for older adults. Particularly when superimposed on other age-related conditions, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) places older adults at risk for social isolation and associated psychological and general health sequelae. The increasing cognitive demand of verbal communication and the diminished sense of social and physical connectedness can contribute to a feeling of vulnerability and poor health that worsens with advancing presbycusis. This cascade of downstream effects of hearing loss has implications for the self-assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and resulting estimates of associated costs. There is accumulating evidence of a potential role for CI in older adults with poor word understanding despite conventional hearing aid use. This review of the literature provides strong evidence of the benefits of restoring communication capacity in the deaf and hard-of-hearing geriatric population. There is, however, a lack of attention to communication performance in the real world and HRQoL outcomes, and significant gaps in knowledge regarding how CI rehabilitation interacts with changing psychosocial and functional status with aging. Conclusion A broader conceptual framework than is currently available for the role of CI rehabilitation in the management of severe-to-profound hearing loss in older adults is proposed. It is posited that the use of such a model in future investigations is needed to guide multidisciplinary investigations into the unique challenges of hearing loss in older adults and may open new opportunities for innovation. © 2012, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2012, The American Geriatrics Society.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.453117523

In particular, the study on the usage of social media tools by older adults has been of a core theme to investigate. In this study, the interaction with a social network site tool, Facebook photo albums, supported by an agent embedded in an assistant robot is analyzed. Therefore, we present a study that explores the relationship between the type of interaction with the social network tool, and the level of perceived usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction by the elderly as users. The study found that the type of interface interaction with the social media tool affect the perception of the older adults in usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction: the older adults perceived the Facebook photo albums tool more useful, easy to use, easy to learn and felt more satisfied during the interaction with the robotic interface supported by the agent. Based on the results of this work, we can approach toward the integration of social network sites technologies for older adults and robots, not only for interaction design considerations, but also to help the seniors to overcome technological and social isolation.

351,Voices from the Gila: Health care issues for rural elders in south-western New Mexico,"Background and rationale. A goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative is to reduce or eliminate health disparities in vulnerable populations, including populations from rural and minority ethnic backgrounds. Rural communities, including elderly populations, experience lower rates of personal income, educational attainment, health-insurance coverage, access to emergency and specialty care services, and reported health status than do urban communities. A need exists to address identified research priorities, such as the perceptions of rural elders, their family members, and health care providers. Aims. The purposes of this study were to explore the health care perceptions, needs, and definitions of health for multicultural rural elders in one county of southwestern New Mexico, and to consider practice implications. Ethical issues and approval. Informed consent procedures followed the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research Review Committee guidelines. Research methods. This critical ethnography incorporated ethnographic interviews, ethnographic participant observation, photography, review of pertinent documents, and analysis of contextual factors. The sample consisted of 22 participants. Results/findings. Definitions of health varied with socioeconomic status, encompassing avoidance of contact with the health care system, obtaining needed medications, remaining independent, a sense of spiritual belonging, eating wisely, and exercising moderately. Three major concerns emerged from the analysis: the escalating cost of prescription drugs, access-to-care issues, and social isolation. Study limitations. The primary limitation was the small sample size. Although the researcher's position as an outsider to local communities may also have affected the outcome, it provided fresh insight to regional problems. Conclusions. The study addressed national research priorities for a vulnerable group of rural elders. Nursing implications include the need for expanded knowledge and educational preparation regarding elder issues and community-level services, inclusion of elders' perspectives in the planning and delivery of health services, and the need for community-level, interdisciplinary collaboration and advocacy.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.82165792
236,The influence of transport on well-being among teenagers: A photovoice project in New Zealand,"Background: Transport mobility has the potential to greatly affect teenagers ability to independently access their social networks, key activities and destinations. Consequently, it makes sense to consider the role that transport plays in influencing well-being among older adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate how older teenagers perceive the impact of transport on their well-being. Methods: Participatory photography or ""photovoice"" uses photographs taken by those with seemingly little power or status in order to enhance community needs assessments, to empower participants, and to provide a comprehensive description of an issue. This method was utilized among senior secondary school students aged 16-18 in Southland, New Zealand (. n=18; 50% male). Their group discussions of common themes concerning transport and well-being provided richness and depth to each photograph displayed. Results: Photographs and resulting discussions suggested that transport infrastructure played a key role in supporting well-being among participants. Regardless of the destination, photos and narratives by participants who lived close to town, and who were able to walk to destinations as part of their daily trip chain, displayed independence, happiness and positive social aspects of well-being. Living farther away from town elicited photo stories of loneliness and decreased autonomy, with respect to transport. Conclusions: Transport had an influence on the well-being of this group of teenagers. Photovoice projects are a valuable way to engage youth and provide context for new research topics such as this. New knowledge generated by this project will inform future research focused on transport as a correlate of well-being among youth. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.4904944555
184,"Samuel Beckett's ""Rockaby"": Dramatizing the plight of the solitary elderly at life's end","Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's spare, compact, and provocative play Rockaby (1981) is a study in old age, isolation, and disengagement from life. In it, an elderly woman rocks in a chair while the audience hears a distant voice remembering her lifelong search for human contact or communion. The play dramatizes the woman's intense physical and psychological isolation and the last sputterings of her impulse to narrate. Such radical isolation may be a necessary precondition for a person relinquishing the narrating that Beckett equates with being, and surrendering unto death. Despite its apparent simplicity, the play powerfully explores the nature of aging in contemporary society, quality-of-life issues for the frail, solitary elderly in our communities and health-care institutions, and how the elderly prepare for life's end in a death-denying culture. Rockaby is thus a text that can help clinicians and other caregivers appreciate the predicament of solitary elderly persons nearing life's end and better understand how we all must manage one day the lonely, self-abnegating yet also paradoxically self-assertive act of dying. © 2007 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5799821138
285,Home-delivered meals and nutrition status among older adults,"The trend among older adults in the United States is to ""age in place"" instead of opting for institutionalization. To maintain older adults with chronic conditions in their homes and to improve health after hospitalization, comprehensive social, health, and nutrition services are essential. Quality of dietary intake is crucial and yet often underestimated. Calorie needs decrease with age while nutrient needs remain the same, even increasing for some nutrients. This poses difficulties for individuals with functional disabilities who are unable to shop and cook due to physical or mental limitations or on a limited budget. The Older American Act home-delivered meal (HDM) program offers at least 1 healthy meal per day, 5 or more days per week, and targets individuals homebound due to illness, disability, or social isolation and those with greatest economic or social need. This review summarizes the available literature on the relationship between HDM and health outcomes. The HDM program is difficult to evaluate because of the multifactorial effect on health status. However, national surveys and smaller studies show that it is well targeted, efficient, and well liked; provides quality food to needy individuals; and helps individuals remain living independently. Studies show that HDMs improve dietary intake, with greater health benefits when more meals reach the neediest individuals. HDMs also decrease institutionalization of older adults and resulting healthcare expenditures. However, funding has not kept up with increased demand for this program. More studies with improved designs may provide more information supporting the program's impact on nutrition status and decreased health expenditures. © 2014 American Society.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6600649337
139,Social participation and the health and well-being of Canadian seniors,"Background Social participation has been associated with health and well-being in older adults. Data and methods Data from the 2008/2009 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Healthy Aging were used to examine the relationship between frequent social participation and self-perceived health, loneliness and life dissatisfaction in a sample of 16,369 people aged 65 or older. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify signifi cant relationships, while adjusting for potential confounders. The mediating role of social support and the prevalence of reported barriers to greater social participation were also examined. Results An estimated 80% of seniors were frequent participants in at least one social activity. As the number of different types of frequent social activities increased, so did the strength of associations between social participation and positive self-perceived health, loneliness, and life dissatisfaction. The associations generally remained signifi cant, but were attenuated by individual social support dimensions. The desire to be more involved in social activities was reported by 21% of senior men and 27% of senior women. Interpretation Social participation is an important correlate of health and well-being in older adults. It may be that social support gained through social contacts is as important in these associations as the number of activities in which one participates frequently. © Minister of Industry, 2012.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.9093301496
53,Activating embodied communication: A case study of people with dementia using a teleoperated android robot,"Purpose: As the aged population grows, social isolation among senior citizens is one of the leading issues in healthcare promotion. Depression and dementia are the most common forms of mental illness among seniors, and related to functional decline; depression may even increase the risk of incident dementia1. Social isolation is a huge risk factor for the onset of depression, and those without close social ties have an increased risk for developing dementia2. To solve the isolation issue, and improve seniors' well-being by enhancing social connectedness, we propose to employ a teleoperated android robot named Telenoid. By focusing on dementia care, we aim to evaluate the effect of the android on the older person's wellbeing. Method: Telenoid is designed to represent a human presence that can be perceived as anybody. The objective of this minimal design feature is to instill the feeling that a distant interlocutor is actually close to the user. We introduced Telenoid into a care facility ten times intermittently during two months to observe older subjects' changes in attitude over time (Figure 1). As a pilot study, mainly focusing on only two female cases of dementia, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative study that collected narrative and behavioral data from the subjects during conversations. When interacting, the android/teleoperator spoke to them and replied with nodding and hugging them. The residents' behaviors were observed via video recordings, which were coded and analysed. Results & Discussion: The study shows that the elderly residents developed prosocial behaviors and increasingly positive attitudes toward Telenoid. One resident, who was aggressive due to dementia, started to calm down and gradually increased her interaction, verbally and non-verbally, with Telenoid while showing prosocial behaviors such as stroking its head and attempting to give it food (Figure 2). Also, another resident who tended to be isolated and stayed in her room showed a strong attachment to Telenoid from the beginning, started to come out to see it and expanded the various ways of interaction, e.g., by sharing the conversation with other residents. Telenoid encouraged the elderly subjects to be more communicative over time. The prospect of verifying the android's effects on senior citizens in further longitudinal studies is promising. Including possible, beneficial secondary effects on the operators of Telenoid, we consider the conditions for creating a remote community that can promote seniors' integration.",0,0,no SI,1,,,,,0.4386078622
246,Palliative care provision for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of disability, morbidity and mortality in old age. Patients with advanced stage COPD are most likely to be admitted three to four times per year with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) which are costly to manage. The adverse events of AECOPD are associated with poor quality of life, severe physical disability, loneliness, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Currently there is a lack of palliative care provision for patients with advanced stage COPD compared with cancer patients despite having poor prognosis, intolerable dyspnoea, lower levels of self efficacy, greater disability, poor quality of life and higher levels of anxiety and depression. These symptoms affect patients' quality of life and can be a source of concern for family and carers as most patients are likely to be housebound and may be in need of continuous support and care. Evidence of palliative care provision for cancer patients indicate that it improves quality of life and reduces health care costs. The reasons why COPD patients do not receive palliative care are complex. This partly may relate to prognostic accuracy of patients' survival which poses a challenge for healthcare professionals, including general practitioners for patients with advanced stage COPD, as they are less likely to engage in end-of-life care planning in contrast with terminal disease like cancer. Furthermore there is a lack of resources which constraints for the wider availability of the palliative care programmes in the health care system. Potential barriers may include unwillingness of patients to discuss advance care planning and end-of-life care with their general practitioners, lack of time, increased workload, and fear of uncertainty of the information to provide about the prognosis of the disease and also lack of appropriate tools to guide general practitioners when to refer patients for palliative care. COPD is a chronic incurable disease; those in an advanced stage of the disease pursuing intensive medical treatment may also benefit from the simultaneous holistic care approach of palliative care services, medical services and social services to improve quality of end of life care. © 2007 Yohannes; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2069326279

233,Effects of social isolation in adulthood on odor preferences and urine-marking in male rats,"Male rats isolated for 60 days in adulthood spent less time investigating odors of females and urine-marked less over these odors than did males kept in groups of three. Isolated males did not differ from grouped males in their responses to odors of unfamiliar males or their own odors. After social experience the isolated males showed an increase in urine-marking but no change in odor preferences. Individual housing therefore appears to alter olfactory communication in the same way that it does other social behaviors and these changes may be mediated by the same mechanisms. © 1985 Academic Press, Inc.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.3805694223
338,Factors contributing to low weight in community-living older adults.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the factors that influence the dietary practices and eating patterns of low-weight, community-living older adults (aged 65 and older) and to examine the nutritional advice given to them by healthcare providers (HCPs) (e.g., nurse practitioner, medical doctor). DATA SOURCES: A qualitative approach was used to study a convenience sample of older women. Semistructured interviews were conducted. Thematic analysis and open coding were used to analyze data. CONCLUSIONS: Eating alone, social isolation, and stressors are the main reasons reported by participants for low weight. Data gathered in this study provide important insights into possible reasons for low weight in community-living older adults. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: As HCPs, it is important to bring low weight to the attention of older adults and educate them regarding appropriate weight for their age (body mass index [BMI] range >21 to <27 kg/m2 for age 65 and older), to understand that older adults with a BMI of <24 may be at increased risk for poor nutritional status, and to weigh older adults at each office visit to assess change in BMI. Small changes in eating patterns and food intake can potentially play an important role in stabilizing weight. Strategies that address eating alone, social isolation, and stressors need to be pursued.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3998755328
307,"Gender, social engagement, and limitations in late life","This study examines gender differences in the pathways among social engagement, physical limitations and cognitive limitations among U.S. older adults. It improves upon previous literature by longitudinally testing both social benefit and selection hypotheses, examining gender differences in these relationships, gaining modeling advantages through structural equation modeling, and by incorporating the frequency of participation in social activities as an important source of social integration that may influence health among older adults. This study uses U.S. panel data of adults aged 60 and older from the Americans' Changing Lives survey (N = 1642) from 1986, 1989, and 1994 in a cross-lagged panel design to better understand these relationships.

297,Is collective efficacy age graded? the development and evaluation of a new measure of collective efficacy for older adults,"Objectives. Community processes are key determinants of older adults' ability to age in place, but existing scales measuring these constructs may not provide accurate, unbiased measurements among older adults because they were designed with the concerns of child-rearing respondents in mind. This study examines the properties of a new theory-based measure of collective efficacy (CE) that accounts for the perspectives of older residents. Methods. Data come from the population-based Chicago Neighborhood Organization, Aging and Health study (N = 1,151), which surveyed adults aged 65 to 95. Using descriptive statistics, correlations, and factor analysis, we explored the acceptability, reliability, and validity of the new measure. Results. Principal component analysis indicated that the new scale measures a single latent factor. It had good internal consistency reliability, was highly correlated with the original scale, and was similarly associated with neighborhood exchange and disorder, self-rated health, mobility, and loneliness. The new scale also showed less age-differentiated nonresponse compared to the original scale. Discussion. The older adult CE scale has reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing measure but benefits from a more developed theoretical grounding and reduced likelihood of age-related differential nonresponse. © 2012 Adena M.

87,Creating a conversational context through video blogging: A case study of Geriatric1927,"Web-based communication technologies such as YouTube can provide opportunities for social contact, especially between older and younger people, and help address issues of social isolation. Currently our understanding of the dynamics of social interaction within this context (particularly for older people) is limited. Elaborating upon this understanding will make it possible to proactively facilitate and support this form of intergenerational social contact. This study focuses on the experiences of an 80-year-old video blogger (vlogger), Geriatric1927, and a video dialogue that develops between himself and three of his younger viewers on a particular topic. Through a multimodal interactional analysis, we show how vloggers create a conversational context between one another through the YouTube website. In particular we describe how vloggers use different communicative modes to establish eye contact, take turns in conversation, share embodied gestures, share their understandings and negotiate simultaneous audiences. Despite a disconnected and ambiguous sense of the other, YouTube is able to facilitate a conversational context in which common ground is shared and social contact and intergenerational communication can occur. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

132,Which social network or support factors are associated with cognitive abilities in old age?,"Background: Social networks and support have been proposed as cognitively protective in old age. As studies often consider these social factors in isolation the question of which characteristics of the social environment are beneficial remains. Objective: The current study examined associations between measures of social networks (including contact with friends/family, marital status and living arrangement), feelings of loneliness and social support, and a range of cognitive outcomes. Methods: Social network, loneliness and support data were available in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936, n = 1,091) at age 70. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, and factor scores were available for general cognitive ability, and the cognitive domains of processing speed and memory. Childhood cognitive ability data from age 11 were also available. Results: When examined in separate ANCOVAs, lower loneliness and more social support were significantly associated with better cognitive abilities at age 70, though not memory (independently of age, sex, childhood cognitive ability and social class), accounting for about 0.5-1.5% of the variance. When the social factors were considered simultaneously, higher loneliness remained associated with lower general cognitive ability (ηp2 = 0.005, p = 0.046), and those living alone (ηp2 = 0.007, p = 0.014) or with less social support (ηp2 = 0.007, p = 0.016) had slower processing speed. When these final models were repeated including a depression symptoms score as a covariate, the associations between loneliness and general cognitive ability, and social support and processing speed, were no longer significant. However, the association between living alone and processing speed remained (ηp2 = 0.006, p = 0.031). Conclusions: Of the social factors considered, loneliness, social support and living arrangement were most consistently associated with aspects of cognitive ability in older people, and these associations appeared to be partly, though not wholly, accounted for by symptoms of depression. Although longitudinal follow-up is required to examine the causal direction of the effects more definitively, it may be beneficial to promote the development of interventions to reduce loneliness and social isolation, and to increase social support.

120,Familial perceptions of the impact of outcome-focused homecare with older people experiencing dementia and living alone,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether the use of outcome-focused homecare improves the subjective well-being of the familial carers of older people with dementia. It also discusses familial carers' perception of whether this intervention has improved the well-being of their relative. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative study followed the familial carers of 20 service users suffering from dementia over a six-month period. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at three intervals during the six months. The carers were asked to assess their subjective well-being at the start, middle and end of the study. Findings - The key findings were that all 20 familial carers expressed an improvement in their subjective well-being and that of their older family member, who appeared more settled as a result of this model of care. Practical implications - The need to consider the use of outcome-focused care as an intervention strategy for older people living alone in the community. The need to provide supportive environments for the carers of older people with dementia to limit their sense of isolation. The prioritising of outcome-focused care in the most complex and chaotic cases. Originality/value - This study provides an insight into the effectiveness of outcome-focused homecare with older people experiencing dementia as perceived by their familial carers. Previously, research has established that outcome-focused care increased the subjective well-being of non-dementia sufferers. This study dovetails neatly with this in demonstrating the same effect on dementia sufferers as perceived by their familial carers. Additionally, this study also demonstrated that this model of outcome-focused care also improved the subjective well-being of the familial carers themselves. These finding will help practitioners consider the use of this model of homecare as a potential alternative or a delaying strategy to residential care.

The elderly care receiver that give rise t. The abuse. That is, dysfunctional communication betwee. The caregivers and care receivers may, therefore, increas. The likelihood of elder abuse. Grounded in Bugental and her colleagues' work (1993, 1999, 2002) on child abuse, we propose a power-oriented communication model based, in part, on research i. The fields of family violence and intergenerational communication to explai. The likelihood of occurrence of elder abuse in family caregiving situations. We argue that certain risk factors pertaining to caregivers' characteristics - those who perceive high stress in caregiving, have mental health issues, have a history of substance abuse, and/or display verbal aggressiveness - may be more likely to attribute considerable power to those elderly under their custodianship. A. The same time, such caregivers tend to feel powerless and experience loss of control when interacting with their elderly counterparts. When an elderly care receiver displays noncompliant behaviors, caregivers may be prone to employ abusive behaviors (in our model, it refers to physical abuse, verbal abuse, or communication neglect) to seek such compliance. Consequences of such abuse may result in lower self-esteem or lower confidence in one's ability to manage his/her life.

This article illustrates the development of a mobile social application for older people in urban areas in China. The application facilitates the organization of leisure-time activities between older people with similar interests living in adjacent areas. Preliminary social requirements of older peoplewere collected through user interviews, and the major functions and features for the application were determined from the results of the interviews. Usability considerations for user interface design for older people were collected fromliterature and were integrated in the prototype of the mobile application. Older people's acceptance of the application was assessed by demonstrating the prototype to and interviewing 100 older people living in Beijing. The results highlight the critical impact of perceived benefits or relevancy on older people's adoption of new technology.

311,Humane care: Seeing the person behind the patient-A case study,"This article is about the importance of retaining a focus on the humanity of older adults while rendering care to them through community and long-term care services. It is written from my experience as a director of a community service (Adult Day Health Care [ADHC] program), a program officer at a foundation devoted to improving health care for older Americans, a researcher who spent years conducting interviews with staff workers in long-term care services, and from the perspective of a professional and personal caregiver and friend to many elders living in the community-in their own homes and in nursing homes. From these diverse professional and personal roles and perspectives, I have learned that the formation of authentic human relationships, which go beyond the routine medical, nursing, and social work approach to care, can play a vital role in healing and addressing loneliness in elders-and transform the lives of their personal and professional caregivers as well. A focus on humanity need not cost money or place a heavy demand on the worker. In fact, it can be one of the most cost-effective approaches to improving quality in health care, attracting workers to the field of long-term care, and boosting the morale of both caregivers and care recipients. © 2011 Springer Publishing Company.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6260754649

This survey seeks to extend our knowledge of the relationship of sexual attitudes and preferences to sexual functioning of a large group of older, community-dwelling men. Methods. Older men aged 58-94 (N = 1,202) were surveyed with an anonymous self-administered questionnaire including 63 items regarding present and past, actual and desired sexual practices and attitudes. Results. Although age correlated consistently with increased erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual activity, a substantial number of older men continued active sexual behaviors supported by positive attitudes toward sexual function. It was found that both health status and perceived partner's responsiveness are prominent moderators of the age effect. Conclusion. In the absence of social isolation and health issues, many older men show persistently active sexual lifestyles as evidenced in their interest and participation in sexual activities.

92,An Administrator's Perspective on the Organization of Physical Activity for Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities,"Background: The positive influence of physical activity (PA) on health is well documented. Even at old age, PA remains useful but participation in PA decreases with age. In long-term care facilities (LTCFs), PA appears to be reduced to a bare minimum. Because administrators have a key role in developing the care policy of LTCFs, it is important that they support the organization of PA in LTCFs. Objective: The main objective of this mixed-method study was to identify motivators and barriers for organizing PA in LTCFs according to administrators. A secondary goal was to examine the knowledge of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines regarding PA and to reveal potential motivators and barriers for the implementation of the guidelines. Methods: First, 24 administrators completed semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using the deductive approach of qualitative content analysis. The obtained motivators and barriers were categorized on 3 different levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community) according to the socioecological model by 2 independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved with a third researcher. Next, 127 administrators of Flemish (Belgium) LTCFs completed an online questionnaire survey containing open-ended, unique, and multiple choice questions regarding the LTCFs, PA, and the WHO guidelines, as well as statements (scored on a 5-point Likert scale) regarding perceived motivators and barriers for organizing PA sessions in the LTCF. Results: In the qualitative component, the administrators reported 31 motivators and 24 barriers for organizing PA in the LTCF. In the survey, maintaining or enhancing general health of the residents (98%) and improving the psychological well-being of the residents were marked as key motivators at the intrapersonal level. The administrators (97%) were convinced that PA is a useful way to spend time for LTCF residents. Encouraging social contact (94%) and countering loneliness (86%) are the motivators cited at the interpersonal level. At the community level, the infrastructure of the facility (91%) and adequate and sufficient material (88%) are the main motivators. The barriers that were presented to the participants were scored as less important. The majority of the administrators (83%) are not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA; 70% of the participants believe that the guidelines are useful, but only 40% is convinced that it is realistic to implement the guidelines in an LTCF. Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for administrators to organize PA in LTCFs. Contrary to other studies, lack of staff, lack of adequate equipment, and lack of financial resources were rejected as potential barriers for organizing PA. Despite the fact that administrators were not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA, they believed that the guidelines are useful. The participants reported several barriers for implementation of the guidelines. Administrators of LTCFs are motivated to implement the guidelines if PA can be integrated in daily activities and education of LTCF staff regarding PA is provided. © 2016 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3814998581
3,A new pattern in long-term care in hungary: Skype and youth volunteers,"This paper presents the results of a model programme in Hungary designed to test the hypothesis that internet-illiterate elderly people receiving long-term care at home would cease to feel lonely if they could learn to use Skype. The research had positive results: older people learnt to use Skype, and communication via Skype not only strengthened family and interpersonal relations but also improved the elderly persons' mental state without the need for physical activity on the part of the carers. A new element of the action research was the inclusion of young 14-16-year-old volunteers. It was the transfer of knowledge from the youngest actors that enabled this change in the network of contacts and the mental state of the elderly people. The rapid and positive result of the transfer is linked to the regular voluntary activity, in a new form of ""playful"" volunteering. For the young people, the volunteering (a subject they take at school) became enjoyable, not just something they had to do. Through the young people, sick home-bound elderly people were successfully integrated into society, and new intergenerational relationships were formed.

304,Subjective well-being amongst community-dwelling elders: What determines satisfaction with life? Findings from the Dublin Healthy Aging Study,"Background: Life satisfaction is a subjective expression of well-being and successful aging. Subjective well-being is a major determinant of health outcomes in older people. The aim of this study was to determine which factors predicted well-being in older people living in the community as measured by their satisfaction with life. Methods: The relationship between life satisfaction, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI-A) and physical, cognitive and demographic variables was examined in 466 older people living in the community using a stepwise regression model Results: Depression, loneliness, neuroticism, extraversion, recent participation in physical activity, age and self-reported exhaustion, were the independent predictors of life satisfaction in our elderly cohort. Conclusion: Subjective well-being, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Scale, is predicted by depression, loneliness, personality traits, recent participation in physical activity and self-reported exhaustion. The mental and emotional status of older individuals, as well as their engagement in physical activity, are as important as physical functionality when it comes to life satisfaction as a measure of well-being and successful aging.

83,The Message Center: Enhancing elder communication,"The Message Center is a home-based communication solution specifically designed for elders. Our research indicates that insufficient communication amongst elders causes several challenges in their daily activities such as loneliness, social isolation, and decreased appetite. The biggest cause of these challenges is that elders are increasingly removed from communication technology including email, text messaging, and mobile phones due to cognitive and physical difficulties. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a familiar pen and paper based interaction that allows instantaneous messaging via digital network. By designing the Message Center, we strive to create an easier venue for more active cross-generational communication between elders and younger family members who are often the caregivers. This paper demonstrates a User Sensitive Inclusive Design process from the generation of user needs to the evaluation of prototypes. A key theme of the Message Center project is to show how usable and emotional design derived from a user inclusive design process can encourage elders to adopt new communication technology.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.2990844227
161,Social isolation and physical inactivity in older US adults: Results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,"Physical inactivity is a risk factor for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. It has been shown that both physical inactivity and social isolation increase with age, and that these factors are detrimental to physical and mental well-being. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical inactivity and social isolation in older US adults. Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994, we assessed the age- and race-specific prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity in relation to various forms of social interaction. The prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity increases with age in both men and women. In non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, the prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity is increased in older US adults who are socially isolated. Social isolation is related to physical inactivity among persons 60 years and older. Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to establish whether increased social support translates to a more active population of older adults. © 2011 European College of Sport Science.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.9465655961

In this study, based on prior research findings in sociology, communications, and informatics, A Model of Computer-Mediated Social Support Among Older Adults that explains relationships among a computer-mediated social network (CMSN), perceived functional social support from that network, and psychological well-being of community dwelling older adults was proposed. The primary purpose of this study was to test this model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).",0,0,"survey, no intervention, no SI",0,,,,,0.3633440845
247,Mammary cancer and social interactions: Identifying multiple environments that regulate gene expression throughout the life span,"Now that the human genome has been sequenced, along with those of major animal models, there is an urgent need to define those environments that interact with genes. The traditional view focuses on ways that gene products interact with the nuclear environment to regulate cell function, causing the physiologic changes, behaviors, and diseases manifest throughout development and aging. Although this view is essential, it is equally essential to understand the converse relationship, namely, to identify those environments at higher levels of organization that regulate the expression of specific genes. Given the vastness of this problem, one effective strategy is to start with a trait for which some of the genes have already been identified, such as malignant disease. In rats, social isolation and hypervigilance increase the incidence of mammary tumors, accelerate aging, and shorten the life span. We propose that similar environmental regulation of gene expression may underlie the disproportionately high mortality from premenopausal breast cancer of Blacks, a minority group that can experience high levels of loneliness and hypervigilance. Our goal is to identify which environments-social, psychological, hormonal, and cellular-regulate genetic mechanisms of mammary cancer risk as well as the specific times in the life span when they do so.

312,Country of origin predicts nutrition risk among community living older people,"Objectives: To assess the nutrition risk status of community living older people and to identify associated risk factors. Design: A cross-sectional study using convenience sampling. Setting: North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand. Data collection was carried out by a research nutritionist using computer assisted personal interviewing in the participant's own home. Participants: Fifty-one independently living people aged between 80 and 85 years. Measurement: A survey using three validated questionnaires: Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) to evaluate social networks; Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing and Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) to assess nutrition risk. Results: A third of the participants (31%) were at high risk of malnutrition (SCREEN II score <50; range 29-58 out of maximum score of 64). The majority of participants (82%) lived alone and nearly half (47%) had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. Low self-rated health, disability and social factors (being born outside of New Zealand, losing a spouse and loneliness) were key underlying factors associated with being at nutrition risk. Conclusion: Nutrition risk is common among aged individuals living in the community. Health and social factors that shape eating behaviours place older people at increased nutrition risk. Strategies are needed for the early identification of risk factors to prevent nutrition problems. Engaging older people at risk to share meal preparation and dining experiences may foster better outcomes. © 2011 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6642048917
97,Aligning the social interaction spaces of intergenerational family members,"The adoption of digital media for supporting social interaction among family members has caused a misalignment between the social interaction spaces of different generations. This usually produces social isolation in the elderly people due to their limitations on using digital media. This thesis work studies cross-generational family communication practices, in order to provide insights for designing computer-mediated solutions that help reduce the social isolation of elderly people. Based on that, we intend to support family connection through a social personalization model that tries to align the social interaction spaces of the elderly with those of their family members.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6903153081
281,What can we do to improve the patient experience of continence care?,"Incontinence can affect people of all ages and genders and can have devastating psychological, social and financial implications for the individual and his or her family. Many people may fail to seek help with incontinence for years due to embarrassment and stigma, which in turn can lead to social isolation. The prevalence of bladder and bowel incontinence is increasing worldwide, in part due to an ageing population -more people are being looked after in residential and nursing homes than ever before and admissions to acute care due to incontinence-associated conditions have increased. All of these factors increase the burden of care on health and social care staff, potentially leading to a lack of quality services. Dignity is internationally accepted as a fundamental human right, yet a host of public inquiries (such as the Francis Report [2013] in the UK) repeatedly raise the issue of failure to respect patient's dignity, particularly in relation to continence care. This article explores why continence care causes such complicated issues and how community nurses can help to ensure it is seen as an essential element of care, rather than being dismissed as only requiring basic skills.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.9638288353
1,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

213,A study of residents of five old people's homes in Singapore,"Singapore is a multi-racial community, undergoing rapid transformation into an urban and industrialized society. Many Eastern traditions, such as the extended family system, are rapidly dying out. There is also a problem of aged people who migrated long ago to Singapore from China or India without their spouses or children. Many have lost all contact with their families. A study was carried out among 449 residents of five old people's Homes in Singapore. It was found that Chinese and Christians were over-represented. Only 21.8 per cent were born in Singapore. The majority were over 70 years of age, and were single or widowed. More than 70 per cent did not have children or grandchildren in Singapore, and the absence of relatives was the most common reason for admission. Most had very little income or savings. No visits during the past one year were received by 34.1 per cent and most others received very few visits. During one year 69.5 per cent never left the Homes and most others did so very infrequently. Almost three-quarters of the subjects did not participate in any home activities, and slightly over 10 per cent helped in the home. However, fewer than 10 per cent were dissatisfied with their living conditions and only 20.5 per cent said they often felt lonely. The vast majority (86.9 per cent) were happy. © 1983 John Wright & Sons Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6515404057
164,Cultural participation of older adults: Investigating the contribution of lowbrow and highbrow activities to social integration and satisfaction with life,"This paper analyses the contribution that cultural activities make to social integration and satisfaction with life for older adults, using a nationally representative Dutch sample. Older people participate less frequently in social gatherings and have fewer close contacts than the adult population in general. They also experience increased feelings of loneliness. In contrast, older Dutch adults feel better integrated socially, which suggests that feelings of social integration and loneliness are independent of one another. Older adults show higher participation rates in highbrow activities compared to the adult population as a whole. This study, however, shows that lowbrow or undiscriminating behaviours may increase social integration and satisfaction with life. Consequently, it may be appropriate to stimulate older people to participate frequently in lowbrow activities such as popular music events, cabaret, and cinema. Public policy-makers, therefore, can consider changing focus from highbrow to lowbrow activities in order to respond to the social challenges associated with older age. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · New York.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5110429706
262,Mediating asymmetries in family communication: Supporting the eInclusion of older adults,"Background: The rise of mobile Web-based technologies has diversified the mechanisms used by people to socialize, which results in issues in family communication. Among these concerns, the reluctance of older adults to use digital media may cause them social isolation, leading to negative effects in their physical and mental health. Objective: This paper aims to formalize a model to mediate asymmetries in cross-generational communication and support the eInclusion of older adults. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews to the members of 20 cross-generational families. Following the grounded theory approach, we identified emerging themes regarding asymmetries in family communication practices when older adults are involved. We then derived and formalized computer-based mediation strategies using a model-driven engineering approach. Results: We identified three main sources of asymmetries: (1) implicit family agreements in terms of social interaction, (2) capability and preferences for using particular media, and (3) unbalanced socio-affective coupling between the involved parties. The proposed model addresses these asymmetries and provides strategies to coordinate the communication effort of family members with their elders. Conclusions: By using the proposed model, designers of software that supports family communities can conceive effective mechanisms to coordinate and mediate social communication among cross-generational family members through digital means. This allows the elderly to show a better reaction to digital media, thus facilitating their acceptance and appropriation of information technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.5509520872
149,A review of social isolation: An important but underassessed condition in older adults,"Social isolation is a major and prevalent health problem among community-dwelling older adults, leading to numerous detrimental health conditions. With a high prevalence, and an increasing number of older persons, social isolation will impact the health, well-being, and quality of life of numerous older adults now and in the foreseeable future. For this review, a series of literature searches of the CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Medline databases were conducted, using the key words ""social isolation,"" ""social networks,"" ""older adults,"" ""elderly,"" ""belonging,"" ""perceived isolation,"" ""social engagement,"" ""social contacts,"" and ""social integration,"" for the period of 1995-2010. The results show that there is an overabundance of evidence demonstrating numerous negative health outcomes and potential risk factors related to social isolation. However, there is scarce evidence that public health professionals are assessing social isolation in older persons, despite their unique access to very socially isolated, homebound older adults. Additionally, few viable interventions were found; therefore, it is advisable to focus on the prevention of social isolation in older adults. Public health professionals can take steps toward increasing the early assessment of social isolation and referring at-risk individuals to available community resourcesin ordertoprevent social isolation or further isolation, which would serve to reduce the numerous negative health outcomes associated with this condition. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5080765589

114,Aging in urban Japan - Intergenerational reading in Tokyo,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a volunteer network from the Tokyo Metropolitan area that addresses the urge for senior citizens to stay mentally active and provide a possibility for them to participate in intergenerational contact as to feel included and useful to society. Design/methodology/approach - The research derives from literature review, local government documents and online presentation as well as an interview that has been conducted by the Tokyo senior information site. Findings - The REPRINTS (Research of Productivity by Intergenerational Sympathy) network in Tokyo is but one answer that combines a mentally challenging activity with intergenerational contact. The network presents an easy to reach and easy to implement diversion for schools to enable children to experience the traditional form of storytelling and help senior citizens to feel challenged and needed. Practical implications - Learning from the experience of the REPRINTS network could help to set up similar activities in other communities that deal with the same problems and are seeking ways to include senior citizens, help them stay active and useful for the community and encourage intergenerational contact. Originality/value - Japan is one of the forerunners when it comes to aging population. Yet, most research still focusses on the challenges, care and especially problems that occur in dying rural areas. This paper instead tries to take a more positive look to the future and concentrates on urban life and its context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.4149812232
240,The experience of young people with depression: A qualitative study,"People who develop depression experience a maelstrom of emotions as they struggle to understand what is happening to them. While the experience has been comparatively well documented in older adults, much less is known about the depression experience and responses of young people. In this study, we aimed to explore the experience of young people diagnosed with depression. Twenty-six young people were recruited from a youth mental health service. A qualitative interpretative design was used, incorporating semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews. Results provided four overlapping themes, reflecting the young people's difficulties in coming to terms with, and responding in self-protective, harmful and at times life-threatening ways to their depression: (1) struggling to make sense of their situation; (2) spiralling down; (3) withdrawing; and (4) contemplating self-harm or suicide. Study conclusions are that young people faced considerable difficulties coming to terms with, and responding to, depression. Improving young people's understanding of depression and its treatment, reducing community stigma and providing accessible and youth-focused services remain important targets for intervention. It is also important to improve mental health literacy in the community to increase awareness of depression and how mental health professionals, including nurses, respond effectively to the young person. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.09468011768

108,Factors influencing the meaning in life in the old age,"Purpose: This study purpose is to survey community-dwelling elders' level in the meaning of life, to identify factors influencing their meaning of life holistically from the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects, and to provide basic information for developing intervention programs with strategies to enhance community-dwelling elders' meaning of life. Methods: This study is a descriptive research designed to investigate the influencing factors on the meaning in life among community-dwelling elders. The participants were 306 communicable elders (Age=65). Data collected from April to October 2013 were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression. Results: There were significant differences in the meaning in life between gender, age, residential area, educational level, employment status, extra-occupational activity, marriage status, family living arrangement, relationship with people living together, living type, monthly allowance, welfare center visiting times. Significant correlations were found between health promotion behavior (r=.648), social supports (r=.672), self-transcendence (r=.300) and loneliness (r=-.698). Significant predictors of the meaning in life were loneliness, health promotion behavior, subjective health, self-transcendence, social support, vocation status, and family living arrangement. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that it is needed to develop integrative intervention program that can promoting the meaning in life and reduce the loneliness.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6634599701
160,"Social participation and healthy ageing: A neglected, significant protective factor for chronic non communicable conditions","Background: Low and middle income countries are ageing at a much faster rate than richer countries, especially in Asia. This is happening at a time of globalisation, migration, urbanisation, and smaller families. Older people make significant contributions to their families and communities, but this is often undermined by chronic disease and preventable disability. Social participation can help to protect against morbidity and mortality. We argue that social participation deserves much greater attention as a protective factor, and that older people can play a useful role in the prevention and management of chronic conditions. We present, as an example, a low-cost, sustainable strategy that has increased social participation among elders in Sri Lanka.Discussion: Current international policy initiatives to address the increasing prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases are focused on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease and cancers, responsible for much premature mortality. Interventions to modify their shared risk factors of high salt and fat diets, inactivity, smoking and alcohol use are advocated. But older people also suffer chronic conditions that primarily affect quality of life, and have a wider range of risk factors. There is strong epidemiological and physiological evidence that social isolation, in particular, is as important a risk factor for chronic diseases as the 'lifestyle' risk factors, yet it is currently neglected. There are useful experiences of inexpensive and sustainable strategies to improve social participation among older people in low and lower middle income countries. Our experience with forming Elders' Clubs with retired tea estate workers in Sri Lanka suggests many benefits, including social support and participation, inter-generational contact, a collective voice, and facilitated access to health promotion activities, and to health care and social welfare services.Summary: Policies to address the increase in chronic non-communicable diseases should include consideration of healthy ageing, conditions that affect quality of life, and strategies to increase social participation. There are useful examples showing that it is feasible to catalyse the formation of Elders' Clubs or older people's associations which become self-sustaining, promote social participation, and improve health and well-being of elders and their families. © 2011 Holmes and Joseph; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.8643850774
214,Neighborhood environment and the well-being of older tenants in planned housing,"The relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the well-being of elderly tenants was studied through a national area probability sample of 153 planned housing environments and over 3000 tenants in them. Six indices of tenants' psychological and social well-being were used as dependent variables in hierarchical multiple regressions where neighborhood characteristics were entered after personal factors were controlled. Neighborhood environmental factors accounted for a significant proportion of the residual variance in every index of well-being. In general, quiet neighborhoods in small or middle sizes communities where the risk of crime was low were conducive to active and satisfying lives for older people. Well-being tended to be higher in segregated buildings even with other factors such as exposure to crime controlled. Although these residual effects were often small it was concluded that environmentally based interventions could significantly enhance well-being and in many instances have more widespread effectiveness than time-consuming attempts to change the individual.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7143577048
129,Translation and validation of the 18-item Lubben Social Network Scale with older adults in Mongolia,"ABSTRACT Background: In Mongolia, social, demographic, and geographic factors have heightened the need for a reliable means to assess social isolation of older adults. The purpose of this study was to identify, translate, and validate such a measure. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases: translation and back translation of the 18-item Lubben Social Network Scale to Mongolian (LSNS-18-M) and field testing to establish reliability and validity and to explore potential cut-off points. The sample comprised 198 Mongolians aged ≥55 years selected from six hospitals in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Results: Internal consistency and intraclass correlations for the LSNS-18-M were excellent, indicating high reliability. The scale showed strong convergence with social disconnectedness and perceived isolation scales and with the Geriatric Depression Scale. It was also inversely related to self-rated health status, but not to the physical or mental health subscales of the Short Form-12 (SF-12) survey. The LSNS-18-M scores discriminated among three levels of social disconnectedness and three levels of perceived isolation. Regarding content validity, the 18 items loaded cleanly on the same three factors as the original LSNS-18, inter-factor correlations were good, all factors were correlated with the LSNS-18-M, and they accounted for two-thirds of variance in scores. Conclusions: The LSNS-18-M had excellent reliability and good validity with a sample of older Mongolians and should be useful for screening, assessment, and monitoring social isolation. Future studies should examine lack of association with the SF-12 and should assess the scale's use with non-hospitalized and non-urban older adults in Mongolia and with Mongolian speakers outside the country. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2013.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7011760119
203,Sheltered housing and community care,"This paper considers the role of sheltered housing following the introduction of new community care arrangements in 1993 and examines the continuing uncertainty about its exact role as community care continues to develop. It reports on a study conducted in Shropshire, using a postal survey and interviews with older people and service professionals. The study highlights the importance of sheltered housing for older people, particularly in relieving them of concerns about maintenance and repairs, social isolation and security. These factors were crucial for their overall peace of mind and quality of life. While only a small proportion of tenants received help under social services' community care arrangements, the additional support, monitoring and service coordination provided by wardens helped some of them to remain in sheltered housing when residential or nursing home care might otherwise have been necessary. Sheltered housing was overwhelmingly popular with older people - but their satisfaction was closely associated with the availability and quality of the warden service. Although sheltered housing is not currently in vogue in housing policy, the paper argues that it plays a vital role in local provision for older people and needs to be more closely integrated into community care policy, while at the same time preserving the characteristics that make it popular with its residents.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.6571461313
123,More than A to B: The role of free bus travel for the mobility and wellbeing of older citizens in London,"This study contributes to the literature on mobility and wellbeing at older ages through an empirical exploration of the meanings of free bus travel for older citizens, addressing the meanings this holds for older people in urban settings, which have been under-researched. Taking London as a case study, where older citizens have free access to a relatively extensive public transport network through a Freedom Pass, we explore from a public health perspective the mechanisms that link this travel benefit to determinants of wellbeing. In addition to the ways in which the Freedom Pass enabled access to health-related goods and services, it provided less tangible benefits. Travelling by bus provided opportunities for meaningful social interaction; travelling as part of the 'general public' provided a sense of belonging and visibility in the public arena-a socially acceptable way of tackling chronic loneliness. The Freedom Pass was described not only as providing access to essential goods and services but also as a widely prized mechanism for participation in life in the city. We argue that the mechanisms linking mobility and wellbeing are culturally, materially and politically specific. Our data suggest that in contexts where good public transport is available as a right, and bus travel not stigmatised, it is experienced as a major contributor to wellbeing, rather than a transport choice of last resort. This has implications for other jurisdictions working on accessible transport for older citizens and, more broadly, improving the sustainability of cities. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.816229511

375,"The personalized reminder information and social management system (PRISM) trial: Rationale, methods and baseline characteristics","Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older adults. To date, there have been limited robust systematic efforts to evaluate the psychosocial benefits of technology for older people and identify factors that influence both the usability and uptake of technology systems. In response to these issues, we developed the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), a software application designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities and access to resources. This trail is evaluating the impact of access to the PRISM system on outcomes such as social isolation, social support and connectivity. This paper reports on the approach used to design the PRISM system, study design, methodology and baseline data for the trial. The trial is multi-site randomized field trial. PRISM is being compared to a Binder condition where participants received a binder that contained content similar to that found on PRISM. The sample includes 300 older adults, aged 65-98. years, who lived alone and at risk for being isolated. The primary outcome measures for the trial include indices of social isolation and support and well-being. Secondary outcomes measures include indices of computer proficiency, technology uptake and attitudes towards technology. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12. months post-randomization. The results of this study will yield important information about the potential value of technology for older adults. The study also demonstrates how a user-centered iterative design approach can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of an intervention protocol. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",0,?,"protocol, no intervention",0,,,,,0.6782013574
124,Reduction in the number of hospital beds in a super-aging society: an upsurge in isolation deaths.,"This study examines the factors leading to more elderly Japanese patients dying alone, the costs associated with this, and potential solutions. This is done through a review of the literature and data concerning Japanese housing policies, elderly households, isolation deaths and the costs of medical care and long-term care (LTC). Due to the decline of the domestic economy, Japanese home ownership has lost its former function of asset-building, and elderly households are overspending. The demand for a final residence for low-income, frail, elderly tenants, who have greater risks of isolation deaths, will be increasing, especially in urban areas where there are inadequate postmortem examination systems. Elderly patients requiring a high level of treatment are forcibly discharged from hospitals and LTC costs peak after 90 years of age. Local governments should do what they can to facilitate the opening of more specialized nursing homes. It is essential to provide hospital beds to elderly patients with the imminent risk of dying to prevent them from isolation deaths because it is a human right to die with dignity. In order to accommodate elderly patients who need extensive medical treatments and to provide an appropriate place for the point of death, more convalescent beds are needed. Collaboration with hospitals, local governments, and integrated community care support centers (ICCSC) is the key to solving this problem.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.3217758163

To obtain results a question paper is to be handed out to a sample of 419 people aged between 55 and 94 and taking part in the «Inter-university Programs of Experiences» from the University of Burgos. The obtained results match up with previous studies that pointed a noticeable increase in the use of the Internet (in frequency, number of users and resources) caused by elderly people's desire to keep active, up-to-date and communicated, as well as their need to continue their learning process through tools linked to the network.

180,"Causal beliefs, social participation, and loneliness among older adults: A longitudinal study","Loneliness can be seen as a social failure subject to causal search: Why am I lonely? Why do I lack friends? According to attribution theory, answers to these questions can influence emotions, motivation, and behaviours. This study examined the relationships between various affiliative causal beliefs (i.e., beliefs about loneliness and friendship development), social participation, and loneliness among older adults (72+ years). Cross-sectional and longitudinal (over five years) results showed that more strongly endorsing internal/controllable causal beliefs (i.e., believing that making friends depends on effort) related to greater social participation. Moreover, greater social participation related to less loneliness. External/uncontrollable causal beliefs predicted greater loneliness.

289,Future housing and support needs of people with dementia,"In an ageing society such as Australia, there is growing recognition of the importance of planning for the future care of older people with dementia (PwD). Dementia is predicted to become the leading cause of disability by 2016, with the number of cases in Australia expected to increase to close to 1 million by 2050 (AIHW 2007, p.52). While there is a growing literature around managing dementia, to date, insight into the role of housing in supporting PwD and the planning and coordination of health and housing services has been limited. This project on the Future housing and support needs of people with dementia aims to address this gap. In Chapter 1, we provide an introduction to the project and the report. This includes an outline of: the research and policy significance of the project; the major themes and questions that frame the research; and the structure of the Positioning Paper. In Chapter 2, we examine recent international and national research on dementia and housing. Key findings emerging from this review include: Housing is recognised as a critical protective factor in relation to the health and well-being of older Australians. Older Australians have articulated a desire to retain independence and they support a consumer-directed approach to health care. A substantial proportion of PwD live in the community, an estimated 70 per cent of all PwD, and this is expected to grow over the coming decades. A PwD's home is critical to their quality of life, with PwD more likely than others in the community to be spending a significant proportion of their time in the home. Continuing to live in their family home and share their lives with loved ones is of primary significance in enabling PwD to cope with the challenges of loss of memory function. One of the major advantages of PwD remaining in their own home following diagnosis is that the home is a familiar environment. For PwD, remaining in their own home holds distinct advantages during the mild and moderate stages of the condition, but this situation changes as the condition progresses. Co-resident caregivers become a critical companion in supporting PwD to continue to undertake tasks they are competent in and assisting with tasks when the PwD experiences a loss in capacity. PwD who live alone are at risk of social isolation, self-neglect, self-injury, depression, and exploitation by others. PwD are more likely to be female and to have lower incomes and they are less likely to access services and support. There are a range of design interventions and assistive technologies that can make a difference to the well-being of PwD and allow them to continue to mobilise remaining strengths and capacities. Home modifications are effective in decreasing the incidence of accidents and injury, and they can strengthen home-based social relationships and networks and reduce strain on caregivers. PwD are more likely to remain in place if supported by live-in carers, but carers' own pressing needs for appropriate housing are less often addressed, particularly those on low incomes. The impact of an ageing population on the housing sector is substantial, with older households projected to grow from 1.6 to 3.2 million between 2008 and 2028. An AHURI study of older persons in public housing (2008) found that housing authority staff felt that they were not well-equipped to assist tenants with dementia and that they have little knowledge of, and limited relationships with, community aged care services. The establishment of a National Indigenous Dementia Strategy reflects growing awareness of dementia as a public health concern in Indigenous communities and the need for a coordinated, partnership approach between Indigenous communities, governments, health networks and the research community in responding to community need. The role of housing is not well understood in relation to cognitive decline and dementia in Indigenous communities. However, it is recognised that poor living conditions and poor quality housing exacerbate problems for Indigenous people in remote areas with dementia. PwD, as their condition advances, will typically transition into residential care. The literature identifies three consistent predictors of entry into residential care: dementia severity and cognitive decline; behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; and caregivers' health and burden. Studies of transitions into residential care highlight the importance of participation by both PwD and their carers in the decision to enter into residential care. Service-integrated housing in Australia is experiencing moderate growth, primarily within the community and private sector. More research and policy development is required to ensure that this form of housing provision can support a diverse aged population. In Chapter 3, we examine available secondary data on the housing circumstances of older Australians and PwD. Key findings emerging from this review of secondary data sources relating to PwD include: There are 266 574 PwD in Australia in 2011. This is projected to increase to 553 285 people by 2030 and 942 624 by 2050. Dementia rates are relatively low until the age of 70 years and then incidence rates increase rapidly. In 2011, there were approximately 157 864 PwD living in an owner-occupied home, with 145 735 living in a home that is owned outright and a further 12 129 living in a mortgaged home. In 2011, there were approximately 11 756 PwD living in private rental and 8957 PwD living in public housing. The number of PwD living in public housing is expected to increase from 8957 people in 2011 to 12 916 in 2020 and 31 672 in 2050. The number of PwD living in private rental housing is expected to increase from 11 756 people in 2011 to 16 952 in 2020 and 41 570 in 2050. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 6003 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia; 643 of these were aged 55-64 years and 5360 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 1742 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia and who were experiencing housing stress; 262 of these were aged 55-64 years and 1480 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011, 30 per cent of PwD lived in cared accommodation, while 70 per cent lived in the community. In relation to living arrangements, in 2009 almost 9 in 10 (88%) PwD who lived in private dwellings lived with others, while 12 per cent lived alone. Men were more likely than women to have been living with others (93% and 84% respectively). In 2009, about 9 in 10 (92%) PwD living in the community were receiving care from one or more carers. Most PwD were being cared for by family, either their spouse/partner or their child/ren. Around 42 per cent of main carers of a person with dementia were the spouse/partner of the care recipient and 44 per cent were the son or daughter. PwD living in the community were most likely to need assistance with mobility (80%), followed by self-care (62%). They were least likely (39%) to need help with communication. In the final chapter, we provide an outline of the primary data collection stage of our project. This entails interviews conducted in two case sites, South Australia (SA) and Tasmania. The research team will conduct approximately 15 interviews with relevant stakeholders in each case site. Relevant stakeholders include: housing managers, social workers and aged care service providers. The research team will then conduct approximately 10 interviews with PwD and their carers across a range of low cost housing settings, including low income owner-occupiers, private rental tenants and public and community housing tenants. The interviews will be transcribed and analysed using the qualitative data analysis computer software package NVivo.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.8200139903
261,Ethics in Evaluating a Sociotechnical Intervention with Socially Isolated Older Adults,"The purpose of this article is to consider how ethical principles can inform the effective design and implementation of technology-based interventions that aim to promote the well-being of socially isolated older adults. We evaluated a new iPad application with small groups of older adults. In this article, we reflect on the ethical issues encountered at each stage of the research process. Drawing on the ethical principles of beneficence, research merit and integrity, justice, and respect, we identify key issues to consider in the future design and implementation of social isolation interventions that use new technologies. Key issues include (a) providing sufficient support to facilitate ongoing social interactions, (b) managing older adults' expectations, (c) providing encouragement without coercion, and (d) responding to individual needs. We conclude that it is important to report on ethical challenges incurred when evaluating social isolation interventions to inform future research in this important area. © SAGE Publications.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.6356812295
112,"""The we's have it"": Evidence for the distinctive benefits of group engagement in enhancing cognitive health in aging","Aligned with research in the social capital and general health literature, a large body of evidence shows that older people who are more socially active have better cognitive integrity and are less vulnerable to cognitive decline. The present research addresses the question of whether the type of social engagement (group-based vs. individual) has differential effects on these cognitive health outcomes. Drawing on population data (N = 3413) from three waves (i.e., Waves 3, 4 and 5) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated the independent contribution of group and individual engagement in predicting cognitive functioning four years later. Hierarchical linear regression was used entering age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and physical health as covariates. The final model, controlling for initial cognitive function and social engagement (both group and individual) showed that only group engagement made a significant, sustained, and unique contribution to subsequent cognitive function. Furthermore, the effects of group engagement were stronger with increasing age. These findings extend previous work on the social determinants of health by pinpointing the types of relationships that are particularly beneficial in protecting cognitive health. The fact that group engagement optimized health outcomes, and that this was especially the case with increasing age, has important implications for directing community resources to keep older adults mentally active and independent for longer. © 2014.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.5632386371
117,Seasonal variation and homes: Understanding the social experiences of older adults,"There has been limited research on the importance of seasons in the lives of older adults. Previous research has highlighted seasonal fluctuations in physical functioning-including limb strength, range of motion, and cardiac death-the spread of influenza in seasonal migration patterns. In addition, older adults experience isolation for various reasons, such as decline of physical and cognitive ability, lack of transportation, and lack of opportunities for social interaction. There has been much attention paid to the social isolation of older adults, yet little analysis about how the isolation changes throughout the year. Based on findings from an ethnographic study of older adults (n = 81), their family members (n = 49), and supportive professionals (n = 46) as they embark on relocation from their homes, this study analyzes the processes of moving for older adults. It examines the seasonal fluctuations of social isolation because of the effect of the environment on the social experiences of older adults. Isolation occurs because of the difficulty inclement weather causes on social interactions and mobility. The article concludes with discussion of the ways that research and practice can be designed and implemented to account for seasonal variation. © Springer Publishing Company.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.7732019882
349,Undernutrition in the UK,"There is a nutritional component to most illnesses (whether poor nutrition leads to disease or disease adversely affects nutritional status) and their treatment, often involving all the health care professions. Undernutrition can adversely affect every system of the body such as the muscular system (resulting in fatigue, lethargy and decreased peripheral and respiratory muscle strength), the immune system (predisposing to and delaying recovery from infection) and psycho-social function (causing anxiety, depression and self-neglect). As a consequence, undernutrition consumes a disproportionate amount of health care resources. It is estimated that 70% of undernutrition in the UK goes unrecognised and untreated and that, in the community, 5% of the population have a body mass index (BMI) less than 20 kg/m2. In hospitals this figure rises to 20-25%. It is important to recognise that not all people with low BMI are undernourished; some may be perfectly healthy. There are difficulties in defining undernutrition because the anthropometric measurements used are neither age nor disease specific. Ranges and cut-off points to define normal or ideal have been based on healthy young individuals and are applied to the whole population. However, the three key elements that help define undernutrition or risk of undernutrition are: assessment of chronic protein-energy status, history of weight loss, and underlying risk factors including disease and disabilities. Patients may be malnourished on admission to hospital as a result of a variety of disease-related, social or psychological factors. Mental illnesses such as depression and dementia cause anorexia. Malignancy and acute or chronic physical disease reduce appetite and alter the taste, smell and preferences for different types of food. Infections and malignant disease may also increase nutritional requirements. Neurological and mechanical impairment of swallowing and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract affect nutritional intake. Factors such as social isolation and poverty can play an important role, and disability and immobility can interfere with food purchase and preparation. Taste appreciation also alters with ageing. It is reported that 40% of all patients admitted to hospitals are undernourished, half of them severely so. Nutritional status tends to worsen during hospital stay and is associated with a worse outcome of the disease and prolonged hospital stay. Studies have shown that 40% of hospital food is wasted, which results in patients receiving only 70% of their energy and protein requirements. Because many patients are discharged from hospital in a worse nutritional state than they entered, a further group of undernourished individuals are discharged into the community, setting up a vicious circle. This can largely be prevented or treated with appropriate screening and management. Weight loss often continues in many patients during their hospital stay for many reasons. These include surgical treatments and investigations that impair appetite or the ability to eat (while increasing nutritional requirements) or treatments and procedures that require a period of nil-by-mouth beforehand, which reduces intake. Frustratingly, sometimes a patient may be nil-by-mouth all morning only to have the treatment delayed or postponed to a later date. Often when the patient returns to the ward, no meal has been saved for them (due to lack of communication or lack case, implementing measures such as improved staff training, nutritional screening and assessment, and monitoring, combined with better catering practices will result in most patients' nutritional requirements being met. Fortified meals, between-meal snacks and adequate ward staffing have all been shown to contribute to achieving this goal, which leads to better clinical outcome, less waste, a shorter hospital stay and a more cost-effective service. Recently, a number of schemes and initiatives have been set up to help prevent or combat malnutrition both in hospitals and the community. These include the launch of Better Hospital Food: a new menu for the National Health Service, and the establishment of the Malnutrition Advisory Group, a group of experts convened to raise awareness and understanding of issues of undernutrition. Community initiatives include the establishment of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit for deprived neighbourhoods, Sure Start - set up to operate local programmes for children and parents living in areas of high poverty, and Healthy Living Centres - set up to run schemes such as luncheon clubs for older people.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.3876561066

291,Communication and coordination for institutional dementia caregiving in China,"With a general trend worldwide towards greater life expectancies, interventions and tools that can help caregivers working in elder care are becoming increasingly important. In China, with a greater number and proportion of elders due to the long-term effects of the one-child policy, these interventions and tools are needed even more. Improved communication between care staff of an institutional home can reduce medical errors and improve coordination of care. At the same time, increased conversation with elders with cognitive impairments like dementia or Alzheimer's can help the elder to maintain their cognitive ability, and can reduce negative feelings like loneliness. Our qualitative study with eleven institutional caregivers in Beijing delved into the communication patterns that exist between caregivers and elders with dementia. We found that knowing more about each individual resident's disposition and personal history was helpful in maintaining quality care, that many care staff in China use placating talk as a means to calm or guide elders to a desired action, and that care staff found the topic of past careers or past 'glories' to be the most efficient in getting elders to chat. In addition, we also found that much of the information that is gleaned through working with an elder long-term is not recorded or shared in any official capacity with other care workers, an area where technology could be particularly helpful.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.2731990316
245,Song and brain development in canaries raised under different conditions of acoustic and social isolation over two years,"Early isolation experiments indicate that male songbirds learn their songs during an early sensitive period, although later work has shown that some open-ended learners modify songs in later years. Recent isolation experiments suggest that in some species song has a stronger genetic basis than previously thought. This study raised domestic canaries under different combinations of acoustic and social isolation and followed song development into the second year. Males raised alone in acoustic isolation developed songs with normal syllables, but larger repertoires and also produced syllables with lower repetition rates when compared to controls. The smallest repertoire occurred in males raised in a peer group. Isolate males had a smaller song control nucleus HVC than controls, but there was no effect on nucleus RA or on brain weight in general. In the second year, after introduction into a large normal colony, isolate and peer group males adjusted their syllable repertoire to normal size. In particular, the isolates reduced their repertoire even though the size of HVC showed a significant increase in volume. However, songs of isolate and peer group males still differ in repetition rate and number of single syllables in the common aviary. In contrast, control males showed low syllable turnover and no significant change in repertoire size. Nor did they show any significant change in the volumes of song control nuclei. It seems that complete isolation affects only some aspects of song and brain development, and later socialization corrects some but not all of these in the second year. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,"not OA, not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.5676828571

323,Dizzy - Why not take a walk? low level physical activity improves quality of life among elderly with dizziness,"Background: Dizziness is a very common complaint. The frequency of dizziness increases with age. It affects quality of life negatively for older persons in several ways. Objectives: This study intended to investigate which variables (physical activity, loneliness, health complaints, need of help for daily living and falls) differed between those with and without dizziness and also to investigate which factors affected quality of life among older persons with dizziness. Method: An age-stratified, randomised sample of senior citizens - aged 75 or older - living in the south of Sweden (n = 4,360) answered a questionnaire concerning demographic data, social network, health complaints and diseases, feelings of loneliness, quality of life (Short Form 12), frequency of falls and activities. Results: Dizziness was associated with an increased risk of falling. Falls in the last 3 months were reported in 31% of the subjects with dizziness compared to 15% among those without (p < 0.001). Dizziness also correlated with depression, with 42.5% feeling depressed among the elderly reporting dizziness as compared with 13.2%. Exercise, both light (i.e. go for a walk) or heavy (i.e. work in the garden), correlated with reduced risk of low quality of life among older, dizzy persons, both mental (light exercise OR 0.58; heavy OR 0.48) and physical (light OR 0.62; heavy OR 0.21). The proportion of dizzy persons doing light exercise was 75.6% versus 87.4% among the not dizzy (p < 0.001). Exercise reduces the risk of falling and the risk of being depressed, and increases quality of life. Conclusion: Even light exercise seems beneficial both for improving quality of life and to decrease the risk of falling, which in turn will lower the mortality rate. Older persons reporting dizziness should be encouraged and perhaps helped to exercise. If one could increase physical activity among the elderly, it would reduce the number of falls, diminish medical costs, suffering for the individual, and be of paramount medicosocial importance for society.

372,New trends in retirement,"Some of the trends in retirement that are opening up or may open up in the next decade are briefly discussed. Retired people since the beginning of this century have been observed to migrate to localities that offer a mild or pleasant climate in winter. Some problems related to this retirement migration are summarized. It is pointed out that an appreciable alleviation of conditions may come from experiences in the establishment of retirement communities. We may assist in steering the prospects of the retired in a favourable direction only in so far as interested parties are given the opportunity and the stimulus to confer about current problems and alternative policies, and to think profoundly about their implications.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.6746365096
137,Loneliness trends in the second half of life: Results from the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) [Einsamkeittrends in der zweiten Lebenshälfte: Befunde aus dem Deutschen Alterssurvey (DEAS)],"Background and research questions: In the current paper, it is analyzed whether the extent of loneliness of adults in the second half of their lives has changed between 1996 and 2008 in Germany. Because patterns of objective social integration have evolved differently in different birth cohorts (familial integration in earlier birth cohorts more fragile, more solid in later birth cohorts), we expected different trends in the extent of loneliness in different birth cohorts. Design and methods: The three waves of the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) constitute the database for the analysis: 1996 (n = 3,979), 2002 (n = 2,766) and 2008 (n = 4,392). Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The German Ageing Survey (DEAS) is a nationwide representative survey of the German population aged 40-85 years. Results: Only a minority of people report being very lonely in the second part of life. Between 1996 and 2008, there is a positive trend in the extent of loneliness in the second half of life, i. e., the prevalence of loneliness decreased during this period of time. From 1996 to 2008, the youngest respondents (40-54 years of age) and the middle aged respondents (55-69 years) demonstrated a decline from 1996 to 2002 followed by an increase in loneliness between 2002 and 2008. The oldest respondents (70-85 years of age) experienced a steady decline in loneliness. Gender differences (men are somewhat lonelier than women) remain stable between 1996 and 2008. Discussion and conclusion: While people who are currently old are socially well integrated and, hence, experience loneliness only to a small degree, there is a higher risk for persons who are currently in middle adulthood because their social networks have become increasingly more fragile. Further changes have to be observed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.413681608
41,Silver Memories: Implementation and evaluation of a unique radio program for older people,"Objectives: A unique radio program Silver Memories, specifically designed to address social isolation and loneliness in older people by broadcasting music (primarily), serials and other programs relevant to the period when older people grew up - the 1920-1950s, first aired in Brisbane, Australia, in April 2008. The impact of the program upon older listeners' mood, quality of life (QOL) and self-reported loneliness was independently evaluated. Method: One hundred and thirteen community-dwelling persons and residents of residential care facilities, aged 60 years and older participated in a three month evaluation of Silver Memories. They were asked to listen to the program daily and baseline and follow-up measures of depression, QOL and loneliness were obtained. Participants were also asked for their opinions regarding the program's quality and appeal. Results: The results showed a statistically significant improvement in measures of depression and QOL from baseline to follow-up but there was no change on the measure of loneliness. The results did not vary by living situation (community vs. residential care), whether the participant was lonely or not lonely, socially isolated or not isolated, or whether there had been any important changes in the participant's health or social circumstances throughout the evaluation. Conclusion: It was concluded that listening to Silver Memories appears to improve the QOL and mood of older people and is an inexpensive intervention that is flexible and readily implemented. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",0,1,no remote,1,,,,,0.66967333
290,What Are the Causes of Late-Life Depression?,"Although depression in old age is less common than depression in younger populations, it still affects more than 1 million community-living older adults. Depression in late life has been associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality from both suicide and illness. Its causes are multifactorial but are prominently related to both biologic and social factors. Psychological factors, although less studied in elders, are also important in understanding its cause. In this article, multiple facets of late-life depression are reviewed, including its clinical presentation, epidemiology, and biopsychosocial causes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,"not SI, no tech",1,,,,,0.702034171
226,Empirical redefinition of comprehensive health and well-being in the older adults of the United States,"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a ""state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" Despite general acceptance of this comprehensive definition, there has been little rigorous scientific attempt to use it to measure and assess population health. Instead, the dominant model of health is a disease-centered Medical Model (MM), which actively ignores many relevant domains. In contrast to the MM, we approach this issue through a Comprehensive Model (CM) of health consistent with the WHO definition, giving statistically equal consideration to multiple health domains, including medical, physical, psychological, functional, and sensory measures. We apply a data-driven latent class analysis (LCA) to model 54 specific health variables from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of US community-dwelling older adults. We first apply the LCA to the MM, identifying five health classes differentiated primarily by having diabetes and hypertension. The CM identifies a broader range of six health classes, including two ""emergent"" classes completely obscured by the MM. We find that specific medical diagnoses (cancer and hypertension) and health behaviors (smoking) are far less important than mental health (loneliness), sensory function (hearing), mobility, and bone fractures in defining vulnerable health classes. Although the MM places two-thirds of the US population into ""robust health"" classes, the CM reveals that one-half belong to less healthy classes, independently associated with higher mortality. This reconceptualization has important implications for medical care delivery, preventive health practices, and resource allocation.",0,0,"not OA, no tech",1,,,,,0.7905847153
271,Older people and digital disengagement: A fourth digital divide?,"Digital technologies are becoming more pervasive in all areas of society. Enabling everyone to have access and capability to use the Internet and associated digital technologies, summed up in the term 'digital inclusion', is seen to have wide-ranging benefits to the individual, to the economy and to society. For older people, being digitally included can help them to maintain their independence, social connectedness and sense of worth in the face of declining health or limited capabilities, as well as also offering new opportunities to improve their quality of life. At present however, access to the technology and to the benefits is not equally distributed either between or within nations, and older people tend to be on the 'wrong' side of what is termed the 'digital divide'. Governments globally are developing strategies to promote digital inclusion and indeed Internet uptake is increasing steadily, including amongst older people. However, such strategies have focussed on getting people online, and there appears to be an assumption that once someone is online they will remain 'digitally engaged'. In fact statistics show that some users give up using the Internet, and there is emerging evidence that older people are more vulnerable to the factors which can lead to this outcome. The authors see this phenomenon as a potential but largely unrecognised 'fourth digital divide' which has serious implications for social inclusion. The objectives of this article are (a) to raise awareness of the phenomenon of digital disengagement by considering some of the emerging evidence, (b) to explore some of the potential implications of not recognising and therefore not addressing the needs of the digitally disengaged older population, and (c) to reveal the prevailing gap in knowledge which future research should address.

204,Quality of life and social issues in older depressed patients,"Depression is a common disorder in old age, affecting at least 10% of individuals over 65. In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",0,0,no tech,1,,,,,0.8771803799
252,Predicting older adults’ perceptions about a computer system designed for seniors,"Although computer technology may be particularly useful for older adults (e.g., for communication and information access), they have been slower adopters than their younger counterparts. Perceptions about computers, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, can pose barriers to acceptance and universal access (Davis in MIS Q 13(3):319–340, 1989). Therefore, understanding the precursors to these perceptions for older adult non-computer users may provide insight into the reasons for their non-adoption. The authors examined the relationship between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a computer interface designed for older users and demographic, technology experience, cognitive abilities, personality, and attitudinal variables in a sample of 300 non-computer-using adults between the ages 64 and 98, selected for being at high risk for social isolation. The strongest correlates of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were technology experience, personality dimensions of agreeableness and openness to experience, and attitudes. The emotional stability personality dimension was significantly correlated with perceived ease of use though not perceived usefulness. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that attitudes (i.e., self-efficacy, comfort, and interest) remained predictive of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use when technology experience and personality variables were accounted for. Given that attitudes are more malleable than other variables, such as demographic and cognitive abilities, these findings highlight the potential to increase technology acceptance through positive experiences, appropriate training, and educational campaigns about the benefits of computers and other technologies. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,not SI,1,,,,,0.9006353968
13,Decreases in the feeling of loneliness by virtue of ICT-based social housing services: Is it due to technology use or to the contact with evaluators?,"Purpose: The European project 'Smart technologies for self-service to seniors in social housing' (HOST1) aimed to provide easy-to-use technologies and services in social housing flats to facilitate a better quality of communication and to simplify various tasks. The French HOST partner assessed the effect of using the social network application 'HOST Comm' on the decrease in feelings of loneliness after six months of experiments. HOST Comm is a collaborative website where users create content based on their shared interests. Method: A touch screen tablet endowed with 'HOST Comm' was tested by 39 people ages 56 to 82 (mean=71; SD=5.7). Given the comprehensive TEMSED approach3 employed, the data gathering method included a two-hour semi-directive interview at the onset, followed with up to ten semidirective phone calls during the experiment, and a final interview after six months of use. The number of messages sent, resources created and comments posted by the users were automatically recorded, and a score (S) of these activities was computed. Users having an S value above the median value of the entire distribution were assigned to a group called the 'highly active' users (HAUs), while the others were called 'weakly active' users (WAUs); WAU had an S<11. The feeling of loneliness (LF) was measured using the De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale3 at a baseline and end point. Results & Discussion: The user's LF has significantly decreased during the experiment (t(27)=2.27; p<0.05) (at the onset, it was higher among HAUs). However, contrary to our expectations, despite their use of HOST Comm, HAUs had a significantly lower decrease in LF than WAUs (F(1,33)=5.24; p<0.05; Figure 1). This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that HAUs sent messages without getting responses and thus, WAUs benefited more from the evaluator's presence than the HAUs. These results should be used as a general line of questioning regarding the effects of social networks on feelings of loneliness: Are the effects of the use of ICT based services on LF due to the services or to the contact with evaluators (i.e. a bias)? The important number of interactions between evaluators and users during the experiment was necessary given the important number of effects to be evaluated. Caution must be observed because complex, real life experiments are always subject to bias. Nevertheless, with about forty participants, nearly 120 face-to-face interviews, and almost 400 phone calls, the human experience created by the evaluation task had paramount richness.",1,1,INCLUDED but too short,1,1,1,1,1,0.727142415
78,A usability protocol for evaluating online social networks,"Online Social Networking (OSN) has become one of the biggest successes of the Internet. Facebook is the most popular service with over 800 million users. OSN have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. This study has investigated how people with differing levels of experience using OSN, within different age categories, are able to interact with the core features of Facebook. The goal has been to identify concessions and produce guidelines for designing an OSN for older people. This paper presents quantitative findings from a usability study which utilized eye tracking to observe 20 users' interactions with Facebook. The usability issues that were encountered and how these may be addressed to help older people with social isolation are discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,"no SI, no intervention",0,,,,,0.8085094842
321,"Discourses of dementia: A call for an ethnographic, action research approach to care in linguistically and culturally diverse environments","The methods of ethnography and action research have much to offer to the field of speech-language pathology, particularly as our clinical populations are becoming increasingly diverse. We suggest that practicing speech-language pathologists and students, as well as researchers, will benefit from strategies that use the methods of participatory action research and ethnography as guiding principles to their work. Ethnography seeks to discover meaningful structures in a culture from the perspective of those whose culture it is. Action research, which shares a methodological basis with ethnography, is undertaken with the aim of improving the functioning of the social institution, practice, or structure investigated for the benefit of those most closely involved with that institution or practice. By way of illustration, we use data collected during fieldwork in Louisiana, involving persons with dementia from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds.
