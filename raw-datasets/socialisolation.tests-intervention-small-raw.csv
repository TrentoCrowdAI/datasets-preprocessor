55,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",no SI,1
250,Morphine treatment during juvenile isolation increases social activity and opioid peptides release in the adult rat,"The consequences of juvenile isolation and morphine treatment on general activity, social activity and endogenous opioid release during a social interaction test were investigated in the adult rat. Rats were either isolated or socially housed during weeks 4 and 5 of age and treated daily during this isolation period subcutaneously with either saline or morphine. Directly after a social interaction test at 10 weeks of age, rats were injected with [3H]-diprenorphine and subsequently prepared for in vivo autoradiography. The autoradiographic technique was used to visualise neuroanatomical changes in opioid receptor occupancy, probably reflecting changes in opioid peptide release, as a result of social activity. Juvenile isolation increased general activity during the social interaction test, an effect which was accompanied by a reduction of opioid receptor occupancy in many brain areas, suggesting an increased opioid peptide release as a consequence of socially-induced general activity. Morphine treatment in isolated rats caused an increase in adult social activity and enhanced opioid peptide release in some cortical regions and the ventral tegmental area as compared to saline treated rats. Both social activity and opioid receptor occupancy were unaffected by morphine treatment in non-isolated rats. The present study underscores the role of opioid systems in adult social behaviors as a consequence of juvenile isolation. The results suggest a relationship between social activity and opioid peptide release during social contact. Increased social activity seems to be accompanied by elevated opioid peptide release in distinct brain areas after morphine treatment during juvenile isolation.","not OA, not SI, no tech",1
273,Using assistive technologies to improve lives of older adults and people with disabilities,"In recent times, the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has significantly impacted our lives and daily activities. From 2000-2011, the use of the Internet has increased to 151.7% within North America. As infrastructures in all parts of the continent continue to improve and advance the technological capabilities of the Internet and the World Wide Web, more individuals are its communications potential. Unfortunately, many individuals do not realize that aging or a disability can change how they interact with these two technologies. In the technological society of the United States, there is a gap between young people and older individuals, especially when it comes to using the Internet and the World Wide Web. Older individuals are less inclined to use the Internet or the World Wide Web; and young people generally stereotype older individuals as lonely, conservative, and closed-minded to technology. However, younger individuals do not understand the effects of aging, especially when using mobile or computer technologies. One aspect of this research paper will explore, what types of educational tools exist to help younger people understands the effects of aging? For older individuals, the experience of loneliness can lead to mental health conditions including depression. In addition, older adults who do not stimulate their cognitive memories can lead to Alzheimer's Syndrome and other memory loss conditions. Surprisingly, there is an increase of older adults using the Internet for communications. However, there are still some challenges older adults face with technology. Older individuals may have a fixed income or rely on Social Security or Disability support; this creates problems as computers can be expensive to purchase. In addition, older adults may have difficulties with using the computer, as far as using the hardware or software components. Software obstacles include: small text size, complex menus options, and high level of stimulation from animated software components. This can also include the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. This research will study the interactions between older adults and their use of mainstream technologies. Although older individuals and people with disabilities have increased their use of the Internet they share common difficulties and complications. In addition, their disabilities often expand the aging complications that older adults experience. For people with disabilities, their main struggle is integration within today's society, especially using the computer technologies or Internet. This research will also explore what assistive technology software is available to older individuals and people with disabilities, the emerging field of open source assistive technology, and how assistive technology improves the quality of life of these individuals. © 2012 IEEE.",not SI,1
299,Depression: A modifiable factor in fearful older fallers transitioning to frailty?,"Objective Fear of falling is one of the most common fears among community-dwelling older people and is as serious a health problem as falls themselves. Understanding fear of falling in fallers transitioning to frailty may help us identify effective strategies to reduce it in this already vulnerable group of older people. Our aim was to evaluate the psychological factors associated with fear of falling in a group of fallers transitioning to frailty when compared with robust or non-frail fallers. Methods Cross-sectional design where 301 fallers underwent assessment at the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic in Dublin () is seen. Fear of falling was measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, and frailty was measured using the Biological Syndrome Model. Psychological measures included assessment of anxiety, depression, loneliness, personality factors and cognition. Results Frailer fallers had increased fear of falling when compared with robust fallers (p < 0.001). Age, female gender and lower cognitive scores were associated with greater fear of falling in the robust group. For frailer fallers, higher depression score was the only factor associated with fear of falling on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio of having case level depressive disorder (CESD-8 ≥ 4) if you were a frailer faller was significantly higher than if you were robust (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006). Conclusion Fallers at a transitional level of frailty may represent a particularly vulnerable group psychologically who would benefit most from interventional stratagies with specific intervention components addressing depressive symptoms.

103,Factorial Structure and Measurement Invariance of the PANAS in Spanish Older Adults,"Developmental theories suggest age-related changes in the structure of affect. Paradoxically, the internal structure of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) has not been tested in Spanish older adults by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) despite it is the most widely used measure of emotional well-being in later life. The aim of this study was to examine competing models of the internal structure of the Spanish version of the PANAS, its measurement invariance, reliability, and external validity. Participants were a representative sample of 585 community-dwelling people aged 60 and over, who also completed depression, loneliness and life satisfaction measures. Results showed that the orthogonal two-factor model with correlated errors (RMSEA = .057, 90% CI [.051, .063], SRMR = .084, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97) was the best fitting solution. Measurement invariance analyses confirmed that the two-independent factor structure can be used across young-old and very old people, as well as in both males and females. It showed good reliability (PA: α = .93, NA: α = .83), criterion, convergent and discriminant validity (p < .01). Our discussion highlights the role of age and culture in the experience and expression of emotions.",no tech,0
352,Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging,"This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates. It was also found that this effect is partially mediated by will to live. The sample consisted of 660 individuals aged 50 and older who participated in a community-based survey, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement (OLSAR). By matching the OLSAR to mortality data recently obtained from the National Death Index, the authors were able to conduct survival analyses. The findings suggest that the self-perceptions of stigmatized groups can influence longevity. Copyright 2002 by the American Psychological Association, Inc.","not SI, no tech",0
358,A concept analysis of malnutrition in the elderly,"Purpose. Malnutrition is a frequent and serious problem in the elderly. Today there is no doubt that malnutrition contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Unfortunately, the concept of malnutrition in the elderly is poorly defined. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the meaning of malnutrition in the elderly and to develop the theoretical underpinnings, thereby facilitating communication regarding the phenomenon and enhancing research efforts. Scope, sources used. Critical review of literature is the approach used to systematically build and develop the theoretical propositions. Conventional search engines such as Medline, PsyINFO, and CINAHL were used. The bibliography of obtained articles was also reviewed and additional articles identified. Key wards used for searching included malnutrition, geriatric nutrition, nutritional status, nutrition assessment, elderly, ageing, and weight loss. Conclusions. The definition of malnutrition in the elderly is defined as following: faulty or inadequate nutritional status; undernourishment characterized by insufficient dietary intake, poor appetite, muscle wasting and weight loss. In the elderly, malnutrition is an ominous sign. Without intervention, it presents as a downward trajectory leading to poor health and decreased quality of life. Malnutrition in the elderly is a multidimensional concept encompassing physical and psychological elements. It is precipitated by loss, dependency, loneliness and chronic illness and potentially impacts morbidity, mortality and quality of life.","not SI, no tech",0
