173,Therapeutic effects of an indoor gardening programme for older people living in nursing homes,"Aims: To explore the activities of daily living and psychological well-being of older people living in nursing homes and also to examine the effectiveness of a gardening programme in enhancing socilaisation and life satisfaction, reducing loneliness and promoting activities of daily living for older people living in nursing homes. Background: Life in nursing homes can mean very limited physical and social activity, leading to further decline in function for many older people. Design: This was a quasi-experimental pre and posttest control group design. Methods: Older people from nursing homes were invited to join the eight week indoor gardening programme (experimental group), while older people in other nursing homes were treated as the control group; they received regular care without the eight week indoor gardening programme. There were 26 older people (25 female and one male; mean age 85 years) in the experimental group and 27 (20 female and seven male; mean age 82 years) in the control group. Demographic data including age, gender, educational level and financial situation were collected, in addition to information regarding life satisfaction, loneliness, physical activity and social network situation, before and after the eight week indoor gardening programme for both the experimental and control groups. Also, details of experimental group subjects' experience of the indoor gardening programme were elicited using open-ended questions. Results: There were significant improvements in life satisfaction and social network and a significant decrease in perception of loneliness for older people in the experimental group after the eight week indoor gardening programme, while the activities of daily living were unchanged for both groups after the programme. Relevance to clinical practice: Given the positive effects of gardening activities, it is suggested that they be promoted more widely among nursing home residents. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",no tech,1,1,0,1,0
299,Depression: A modifiable factor in fearful older fallers transitioning to frailty?,"Objective Fear of falling is one of the most common fears among community-dwelling older people and is as serious a health problem as falls themselves. Understanding fear of falling in fallers transitioning to frailty may help us identify effective strategies to reduce it in this already vulnerable group of older people. Our aim was to evaluate the psychological factors associated with fear of falling in a group of fallers transitioning to frailty when compared with robust or non-frail fallers. Methods Cross-sectional design where 301 fallers underwent assessment at the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic in Dublin () is seen. Fear of falling was measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, and frailty was measured using the Biological Syndrome Model. Psychological measures included assessment of anxiety, depression, loneliness, personality factors and cognition. Results Frailer fallers had increased fear of falling when compared with robust fallers (p < 0.001). Age, female gender and lower cognitive scores were associated with greater fear of falling in the robust group. For frailer fallers, higher depression score was the only factor associated with fear of falling on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio of having case level depressive disorder (CESD-8 ≥ 4) if you were a frailer faller was significantly higher than if you were robust (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006). Conclusion Fallers at a transitional level of frailty may represent a particularly vulnerable group psychologically who would benefit most from interventional stratagies with specific intervention components addressing depressive symptoms.

103,Factorial Structure and Measurement Invariance of the PANAS in Spanish Older Adults,"Developmental theories suggest age-related changes in the structure of affect. Paradoxically, the internal structure of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) has not been tested in Spanish older adults by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) despite it is the most widely used measure of emotional well-being in later life. The aim of this study was to examine competing models of the internal structure of the Spanish version of the PANAS, its measurement invariance, reliability, and external validity. Participants were a representative sample of 585 community-dwelling people aged 60 and over, who also completed depression, loneliness and life satisfaction measures. Results showed that the orthogonal two-factor model with correlated errors (RMSEA = .057, 90% CI [.051, .063], SRMR = .084, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97) was the best fitting solution. Measurement invariance analyses confirmed that the two-independent factor structure can be used across young-old and very old people, as well as in both males and females. It showed good reliability (PA: α = .93, NA: α = .83), criterion, convergent and discriminant validity (p < .01). Our discussion highlights the role of age and culture in the experience and expression of emotions.",no tech,0,1,0,1,0
235,"Experiential variables influencing play, foot-clasp mounting and adult sexual competence in male rhesus monkeys","(1) It is concluded that foot-clasp mounting, rather than social play, by juvenile rhesus monkeys is the appropriate index of the affectional development essential for normal adult heterosexual behavior in the male monkey. (2) The opportunity for continuous social interaction with peers, lasting at least three months, resulted in increased frequencies of display of foot-clasp mounts and decreased frequencies of social play by juvenile rhesus monkeys. (3) When the opportunity for continuous social experience was provided during the first year of life, the behavioral changes were manifested immediately and when this opportunity was delayed until late in the second year of life, changes in the frequency of play and mounting were correspondingly delayed. (4) Adult heterosexual competence was greatest in males that had the earliest opportunity for continuous social experience, intermediate in males with delayed social experience, and least in males with no opportunity for continuous social experience with peers. (5) Rearing conditions that produced the highest frequencies of foot-clasp mounting were associated with the highest adult heterosexual competence and rearing conditions that produced the highest frequencies of social play were associated with the lowest adult heterosexual competence. © 1979.","not OA, not SI",-1,0,0,0,0
352,Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging,"This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates. It was also found that this effect is partially mediated by will to live. The sample consisted of 660 individuals aged 50 and older who participated in a community-based survey, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement (OLSAR). By matching the OLSAR to mortality data recently obtained from the National Death Index, the authors were able to conduct survival analyses. The findings suggest that the self-perceptions of stigmatized groups can influence longevity. Copyright 2002 by the American Psychological Association, Inc.","not SI, no tech",0,1,0,0,0
358,A concept analysis of malnutrition in the elderly,"Purpose. Malnutrition is a frequent and serious problem in the elderly. Today there is no doubt that malnutrition contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Unfortunately, the concept of malnutrition in the elderly is poorly defined. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the meaning of malnutrition in the elderly and to develop the theoretical underpinnings, thereby facilitating communication regarding the phenomenon and enhancing research efforts. Scope, sources used. Critical review of literature is the approach used to systematically build and develop the theoretical propositions. Conventional search engines such as Medline, PsyINFO, and CINAHL were used. The bibliography of obtained articles was also reviewed and additional articles identified. Key wards used for searching included malnutrition, geriatric nutrition, nutritional status, nutrition assessment, elderly, ageing, and weight loss. Conclusions. The definition of malnutrition in the elderly is defined as following: faulty or inadequate nutritional status; undernourishment characterized by insufficient dietary intake, poor appetite, muscle wasting and weight loss. In the elderly, malnutrition is an ominous sign. Without intervention, it presents as a downward trajectory leading to poor health and decreased quality of life. Malnutrition in the elderly is a multidimensional concept encompassing physical and psychological elements. It is precipitated by loss, dependency, loneliness and chronic illness and potentially impacts morbidity, mortality and quality of life.","not SI, no tech",0,1,0,0,0
218,Desire for attention,"Seeking of attention appears to be intimately bound up with certain principles of motivation, especially the seeking of observable results of action and of optimum levels of stimulation, variety and challenge, and the relationship between results and the cost of achieving them—a high cost will tend to inhibit action but enhance the value subsequently placed upon what is achieved. These principles can be applied to personal relationships: thus friendship can be regarded as a situation involving facilitative feedback between persons, hostility as involving inhibitory feedback and loneliness as occurring when there is no feedback. Which of these situations occurs appears to depend upon the relationships between the costs and benefits of interaction between the persons concerned. The care of psychiatric or senile patients in the community appears likely to impose demands for attention which are unreasonably severe (“costly”). Any attempt to change community attitudes in the hope of securing greater acceptance of such demands appears to be unrealistic. Substantial benefits could probably be attained in many cases from training in skills, especially social skills, which would enable patients to cope more effectively with the world as it is. © 1977, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

256,Aging and hearing health: The life-course approach,"Sensory abilities decline with age. More than 5% of the world's population, approximately 360 million people, have disabling hearing loss. In adults, disabling hearing loss is defined by thresholds greater than 40 dBHL in the better hearing ear. Hearing disability is an important issue in geriatric medicine because it is associated with numerous health issues, including accelerated cognitive decline, depression, increased risk of dementia, poorer balance, falls, hospitalizations, and early mortality. There are also social implications, such as reduced communication function, social isolation, loss of autonomy, impaired driving ability, and financial decline. Furthermore, the onset of hearing loss is gradual and subtle, first affecting the detection of high-pitched sounds and with difficulty understanding speech in noisy but not in quiet environments. Consequently, delays in recognizing and seeking help for hearing difficulties are common. Age-related hearing loss has no known cure, and technologies (hearing AIDS, cochlear implants, and assistive devices) improve thresholds but do not restore hearing to normal. Therefore, health care for persons with hearing loss and people within their communication circles requires education and counseling (e.g., increasing knowledge, changing attitudes, and reducing stigma), behavior change (e.g., adapting communication strategies), and environmental modifications (e.g., reducing noise). In this article, we consider the causes, consequences, and magnitude of hearing loss from a life-course perspective. We examine the concept of ""hearing health,"" how to achieve it, and implications for policy and practice. © 2016 The Author 2016.",not SI,0,-1,-1,-1,-1
55,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",no SI,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
197,The views of older community residents toward mental health problems,"A series of focus groups were conducted at two senior centers and two senior congregated housing developments in the greater Baltimore Metropolitan area in order to examine the views older adults have about mental health services. Among the several themes that emerged from the focus groups were: (a) depression and anxiety were seen as very common in older adults; (b) barriers such as the stigma, cost, fragmentation of services, transportation, and primary care physicians made it difficult to seek care; (c) seniors felt more resilient than younger adults; (d) seniors had a mixed reaction to others experiencing mental health problems; (e) individuals are responsible for their own mental health care; (f) mental health treatment works; and (g) mental health problems could be prevented. Among the recommendations made by the authors are to increase use of senior centers to reduce social isolation and promote health, education and well-being in a nontraditional setting. Also, primary care physicians must be encouraged and educated in the recognition, screening, assessment, treatment and referral for mental health problems in older adults. And lastly, physicians need to understand how the stigma of mental health problems can cause difficulty when older adults speak about mental health issues.",no tech,0,-1,-1,-1,-1
81,Intelligent integrated networks for aged people,"With the aging of the population and the increase of the health risks, the percentage of old singles grows tremendously. Loneliness and fear are common among elderly people seem to be related to each other and were both found to be ""threats"" to a good life in old age. ICT and technological innovations in other fields offer opportunities to bring independent living in old age. Smart home and consumer electronic developments can make management of the home and everyday living a lot easier for older people. But the automation of a domotic house shouldn't risk to take away the few social contacts an old user still has with human beings. The automation of a domotic house shouldn't risk to take away the few social contacts an old user still has with human beings. The intelligent houses for the old people should consider three class of functions: safety and security, environment comfort and sanitary surveillance. These activities are carried out with respect to the security, the safety and the privacy of the user. In this paper we propose an architecture that allows the maximum help to old people, but that respect their needs. It is organized in two logical networks: a Daily Support Network (DSN) and a Village Network (VN). The focus of this architecture is based on human aspects of the elderly people needs, to improve the quality of life of elderly people and their caregivers. The final goal is facilitating an independent and not isolated, good social life, inside one's home as long as possible.","no SI, no intervention",0,-1,-1,-1,-1
341,Evaluation of community planning and life of senior cohousing projects in Northern European countries,"Cohousing schemes were evolved as alternative housing to reduce housework for working women, and to reduce loneliness of elderly people by promoting active mutual relationship with community residents in northern European countries. This article discusses how residents manage their life in senior cohousing projects in Sweden and Denmark. The purpose of this study is to investigate residents' life satisfaction connected with demographic characteristics of residents, physical environment and common activities in the senior cohousing communities, so that it could offer usable information for the establishment of new senior cohousing projects in other countries, as well as an empirical evaluation of the existing projects in Scandinavian countries themselves. Important variables influential to residents' life satisfaction are also discussed in order to improve senior citizens' quality of life. The methods used for the study are literature review, interviews, field trips and questionnaire. Nine hundred and thirty-five postal questionnares were sent to 28 senior cohousing communities throughout Denmark and Sweden. Of those 536 replies were collected and analysed by SPSS program using frequency, mean and Chi-square test. As a result, it was found out that most of the respondents are healthy, 70-year-olds, and satisfied with their current living in the community. The majority of them also would like to strongly recommend others to move to senior cohousing schemes to improve quality of life in their later years. Residents' intensive concern about building location and design is a noteworthy reminder for designers and architects as well as for professionals and decision-makers who work in the elderly welfare sector. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","not SI, no tech",0,-1,-1,-1,-1
298,Senior centers: Traditional and evolving roles,"The first senior center in the United States, the William Hodson Community Center in New York City, opened its doors in 1943. Its purpose was to reach out to people who had retired but needed a place to gather to stay connected to others. Senior centers serve as an entry point for the aging service network and protect against social isolation. One popular perception - that senior centers are welfare programs - has inhibited many elders from seeking services, and it needs to be dispelled. These centers do not just offer low-cost meals, nor provide institution-like services; they are diverse and vital institutions. Recent studies indicate that participation in senior centers has been declining, and center personnel are looking for new ways to reach the ""young- old"" who have yet to participate and the ""old-old"" who may face challenges getting to the center. Pharmacists are in the ideal position to offer health and wellness programming and caregiver education in this setting. Senior centers are also good places to train students, who are often surprised at the range of seniors' interests and cognitive abilities. © 2012 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

303,"Geriatric vision loss due to cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma","The major causes of impaired vision in the elderly population of the United States are cataracts, macular degeneration, and open-angle glaucoma. Cataracts and macular degeneration usually reduce central vision, especially reading and near activities, whereas chronic glaucoma characteristically attacks peripheral vision in a silent way, impacting balance, walking, and driving. Untreated, these visual problems lead to issues with regard to taking medications, keeping track of finances and personal information, walking, watching television, and attending the theater, and often create social isolation. Thus, visually impaired individuals enter nursing homes 3 years earlier, have twice the risk of falling, and have 4x the risk of hip fracture. Consequently, many elderly with low vision exercise greater demands on community services. With the prospect of little improvement and sustained visual loss, in the face of poor tolerance of low-vision services and not accepting magnification as the only way to read, clinical depression is common. In many instances, however, early and accurate diagnosis can result in timely treatment and can preserve quality of life. This review will look at current diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Currently, about 20.5 million people in the United States have cataracts. The number will reach 30 million by 2020. About 1.75 million Americans currently have some form of macular degeneration, and the number is estimated to increase to 2.95 million in 2020. Approximately 2.2 million Americans have glaucoma, and by 2020 that number is estimated to be close to 3.4 million people. It is projectedthat by 2030 there will be 72.1 million seniors. With some overlap of the above 3 groups conservatively estimated (if you add the 2030 cataract group to the macular degeneration and glaucoma groups), then about 1 in 2 senior individuals by 2030 may have some significant ocular disease, which could account for about 50% of the healthcare budget for the elderly. © 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.","not SI, no tech",0,-1,-1,-1,-1
250,Morphine treatment during juvenile isolation increases social activity and opioid peptides release in the adult rat,"The consequences of juvenile isolation and morphine treatment on general activity, social activity and endogenous opioid release during a social interaction test were investigated in the adult rat. Rats were either isolated or socially housed during weeks 4 and 5 of age and treated daily during this isolation period subcutaneously with either saline or morphine. Directly after a social interaction test at 10 weeks of age, rats were injected with [3H]-diprenorphine and subsequently prepared for in vivo autoradiography. The autoradiographic technique was used to visualise neuroanatomical changes in opioid receptor occupancy, probably reflecting changes in opioid peptide release, as a result of social activity. Juvenile isolation increased general activity during the social interaction test, an effect which was accompanied by a reduction of opioid receptor occupancy in many brain areas, suggesting an increased opioid peptide release as a consequence of socially-induced general activity. Morphine treatment in isolated rats caused an increase in adult social activity and enhanced opioid peptide release in some cortical regions and the ventral tegmental area as compared to saline treated rats. Both social activity and opioid receptor occupancy were unaffected by morphine treatment in non-isolated rats. The present study underscores the role of opioid systems in adult social behaviors as a consequence of juvenile isolation. The results suggest a relationship between social activity and opioid peptide release during social contact. Increased social activity seems to be accompanied by elevated opioid peptide release in distinct brain areas after morphine treatment during juvenile isolation.","not OA, not SI, no tech",1,-1,-1,-1,-1
273,Using assistive technologies to improve lives of older adults and people with disabilities,"In recent times, the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has significantly impacted our lives and daily activities. From 2000-2011, the use of the Internet has increased to 151.7% within North America. As infrastructures in all parts of the continent continue to improve and advance the technological capabilities of the Internet and the World Wide Web, more individuals are its communications potential. Unfortunately, many individuals do not realize that aging or a disability can change how they interact with these two technologies. In the technological society of the United States, there is a gap between young people and older individuals, especially when it comes to using the Internet and the World Wide Web. Older individuals are less inclined to use the Internet or the World Wide Web; and young people generally stereotype older individuals as lonely, conservative, and closed-minded to technology. However, younger individuals do not understand the effects of aging, especially when using mobile or computer technologies. One aspect of this research paper will explore, what types of educational tools exist to help younger people understands the effects of aging? For older individuals, the experience of loneliness can lead to mental health conditions including depression. In addition, older adults who do not stimulate their cognitive memories can lead to Alzheimer's Syndrome and other memory loss conditions. Surprisingly, there is an increase of older adults using the Internet for communications. However, there are still some challenges older adults face with technology. Older individuals may have a fixed income or rely on Social Security or Disability support; this creates problems as computers can be expensive to purchase. In addition, older adults may have difficulties with using the computer, as far as using the hardware or software components. Software obstacles include: small text size, complex menus options, and high level of stimulation from animated software components. This can also include the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. This research will study the interactions between older adults and their use of mainstream technologies. Although older individuals and people with disabilities have increased their use of the Internet they share common difficulties and complications. In addition, their disabilities often expand the aging complications that older adults experience. For people with disabilities, their main struggle is integration within today's society, especially using the computer technologies or Internet. This research will also explore what assistive technology software is available to older individuals and people with disabilities, the emerging field of open source assistive technology, and how assistive technology improves the quality of life of these individuals. © 2012 IEEE.",not SI,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
379,Getting Grandma Online: Are Tablets the Answer for Increasing Digital Inclusion for Older Adults in the U.S.?,"Using information and communication technologies (ICTs) can improve older adults’ quality of life. ICT use is associated with decreased feelings of loneliness and depression, along with increased feelings of independence and personal growth. However, limited access and low technological self-efficacy are key reasons why some groups, especially older adults, are excluded from being fully engaged in the digital world. In this study, we focus on older adults’ technological self-efficacy, which is related to their actual use of technology and the second level digital divide. Specifically, we examine: (a) how older adults decide to use a new technology, tablet computers; (b) how they conquer the barrier of technological self-efficacy through using tablets; and (c) the impacts of using this new technology in their lives. Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with older adults residing in independent living communities in a medium-sized city in the Deep South region of the United States. Observational and enactive learning played important roles for older adults in using tablets. Seeing others use tablets, getting recommendations from family members, or having tablets given to them were the primary reasons they started to use tablet computers. The ease of use feature of tablets helped solve the problem of lacking technological self-efficacy. Using tablets helped increase a sense of connectedness. Tablet computers may be one way to increase digital inclusion among older adults. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","survey, no intervention",0,-1,-1,-1,-1
